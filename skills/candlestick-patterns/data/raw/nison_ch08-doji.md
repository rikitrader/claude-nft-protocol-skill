EXHIBIT 8.9. Intel---Daily (Doji after a Tall White Candle)
this chart, since the white candle line had a higher high than
the doji's high, that becomes our prime resistance area (shown
by the dashed line). With the appearance of the doji, Intel had
become "tired." If Intel had closed over that resistance line,
we would say that the market is refreshed and it would be a
bullish breakout.
THE LONG-LEGGED DO}JI (RICKSHAW MAN),
THE GRAVESTONE DOJI, AND THE
DRAGONFLY DO}JlI
As shown in Exhibits 8.2 to 8.4, some doji have nicknames
depending on if the open/close (i.e., the horizontal component
of the doji) is at the low or high of the session or if there are
unusually long upper and lower shadows on the doji.

A candle line with long upper and lower shadows and a small
real body is called a high-wave candle." If such a candle line is a
doji instead of a small real body, then it is called a long-legged doji
(see Exhibit 8.2). It also has the nickname rickshaw man.

The doji portion of the long-legged doji shows the market is
at a transition point. The long upper shadow shows the market
had rallied during the session, but by session's end had backed
off from these highs. The extended lower shadow visually
depicts a market that had sold off during the session; by ses-
sion's end it had been able, by the close, to recoup some of its
lost ground. In other words, the market rallies, sells off, rallies,
etc. It is a confused market. These long shadows hint, as the
Japanese say, "The market has lost its sense of direction." As
such, a long-legged doji is an indication of a market separating
from its trend.

The gravestone doji (see Exhibit 8.3) is another distinctive doji.
It develops when the open, low, and close are at the low of the

| day. This line is an example of how visually intuitive candles
are. Even if you never saw an explanation of the gravestone
doji, just by looking at it, would you think it was a bullish or
bearish signal? Of course, the answer is bearish. With its
extended upper shadow and close at the low of the session, we
can graphically see that at some time during the session the
stock had rallied and by session's end the bears dragged this
stock down to the lows at the close. It can be viewed as the ulti-
mate shooting star. The shooting star has a long upper shadow
and small real body. If the shooting star's real body becomes a
doji, then we have a gravestone doji.

The gravestone's forte is in calling tops. The shape of the
gravestone doji makes its name appropriate. As we have dis-
cussed, many of the Japanese technical terms are based on mil-
itary analogies. In Japanese candlestick literature it is said that
the gravestone doji represents the gravestone of the bulls that
have died defending their territory.

The dragonfly doji is the bullish counterpart of the gravestone
doji. The dragonfly has the open/close at the highs of the ses-
sion. This means the market had touched much lower lows
during the session, but had impressively managed to close at,
or very close to, the highs. This is like the hammer, but the ham-
mer has a small real body where the dragonfly doji has no real
body since it is a doji.

In Exhibit 8.10 a long-legged doji appeared on October 23. By
using the highest high between the doji and the prior white
candle, we immediately obtain resistance near $88. The index

descended from this long-legged doji until the hammer three
days later. In early November the market was ascending, but
the two long-legged doji put a damper on any bullish outlook.
A further sign of trouble emerged with the November 6 and 7
bearish engulfing pattern. Note how in the early part of
October the stock was falling with doji during this descent. As
previously discussed, doji, based on my experience, work bet-
ter at calling tops reversals than bottom reversals.

An example of a gravestone doji is shown in Exhibit 8.11.
Since the doji's high was the same as the prior session, it is also
a tweezers top. As ominous as "gravestone" sounds, please
don't make the mistake of thinking it implies a large move
lower. While the gravestone doji, because of its extended upper
shadow and close at the session low, does increase the chances
for a turn, it doesn't forecast the extent of a potential decline.
Candle signals are unexcelled for spotting the early reversals,
not to predict the extent of a move. Don't make more out of can-
dles than they are designed to provide. As the Japanese adage
goes, "Don't climb a tree to catch a fish."

EXHIBIT 8.11. Inktomi---15 Minutes (Gravestone Doji)

Although that doji was a reason for caution, I would not have
turned outright bearish on that gravestone doji. Why? Notice
how the close of that doji was still over the late March 22 resis-
tance area near $224. It would take the close on the session after
the gravestone to turn the trend south. That session, with its
close back under $224, proved what the doji had hinted at---
that the new highs couldn't hold.

In Exhibit 8.12 some long-legged doji in mid April signaled
that the prior downtrend was losing momentum near $6.75.
The rally in early May made a rising window. But there was a
problem on the day of the rising window on May 9: It was
another long-legged doji. This signified that the bulls were not
in complete control. The window's support was broken the day
after this long-legged doji. This confirmed the potential for
another down draft. When the stock got near the aforemen-
tioned $6.75 support area from mid April on May 23, it suc-
cessfully defended it with a hammer. The rally from this ham-
mer made two windows at 1 and 2. The stock corrected from
the bearish engulfing pattern at B. The decline from this bear-

EXHIBIT 8.12. 3Com---Daily (Dragonfly Doji)
ish engulfing pattern found stabilization near $8.75 to $8.25
with a series of dragonfly doji. Since the third dragonfly didn't
have the open/close at the high, but near it, I view it as a vari-
ation of the dragonfly doji. These dragonfly doji confirmed
support at the windows at 1 and 2. Final confirmation of the
support came with the June 28 hammer.
The general concept with doji (and for all candle signals) is
that one should look at what happened before the signal. For
instance, a doji in a rally is a potential reversal. Therefore, there
needs to be a rally to reverse. This means that doji have little
forecasting implications if they are in a trading range environ-
ment since there is no trend to reverse. The Japanese aptly call
a market that is locked within a range a "box."
The doji in Exhibit 8.13 is reflecting on a micro scale what the
trading range environment on a more macro aspect is showing:
The market is undecided. With no trend to change, the doji in ---_------
Exhibit 8.13 has no forecasting implications, except for the fact +
that it is confirming a trendless environment. An exception to EXHIBIT 8.13. Doji in a

tom end of a range. As such, it is confirming resistance or sup-
port and could be a useful signal.

| In Exhibit 8.14 let's look at three doji in relation to their pre-
ceding trend. Doji 1 is in the middle of a box range.
Consequently, this doji doesn't have any forecasting implica-
tions since there's no trend to reverse. The same scenario is true
with the dragonfly doji at 2. The doji at 3 is very different
because of where it appears. This doji comes after a rally that
placed the stock into an overbought condition. As such it has
reversal implications. The two doji following doji 3 are echoing
what the first doji at 3 told us---that the stock was running out
of bullish force. To recap: Where the doji is in relation to its pre-
ceding trend is of pivotal importance.

Exhibit 8.15 illustrates a point alluded to previously in this
chapter: Doji during descents (what I call Southern doji) often do
not work well as bottom turning signals. In this chart doji, or
doji-like lines A to F, appeared during a market decline. But these
Southern doji did not signal any reversals. The first sign of a turn
came with the tall white candle on March 3 wrapping around the
two previous doji lines at F. This formed a bullish engulfing pat-

tern that held as support. (There was also a small bullish engulf-

ing pattern at time frame C, but once the black candle closed

under the low of that pattern, the hopes for a bottom were negat-

ed.) An indication that the rally from the bullish engulfing pat-

tern at F was stalling came with the doji like line at 1.

In Exhibit 8.16, I have a series of doji illustrating how differ-
ent market surroundings influence a doji's importance. Let's
look at each individually.
¢ Doji 1. "An earthquake of magnitude 8" is how the Japanese

would describe the action preceding doji 1. Two forceful

black real bodies are followed by equally intense long white
candles that made up all the lost ground of those black can-
dles. The doji at 1 showed the stock was separating from its
trend (in this case the trend was up because of the two long
white candles). As is the case for a doji and tall white candle,
we use the highest high of these two sessions (in this exam-
ple, it is the high of the white candle at 3745) as resistance.
This resistance held on the next session.

¢ Doji 2. This doji came after a short-term decline. (Even if
there are a few down sessions before the doji, I still view the
immediately preceding trend as down.) Therefore, as a doji
in a downtrend, it warrants less attention as a turning signal.
¢ Doji 3. This doji came after a tall white candle. As such, it
does hint the rally that started from 3705 could be losing its
steam. However, is the stock overbought when this doji
arose? In my opinion, it wasn't (compare this to doji 1 that
came after an intense vertical rally). Consequently, this doji
has less meaning than it would in an overbought environ-
ment. Once the market closed over the doji, it negated any of
its potentially bearish implications.
¢ Doji 4. Doji 4 arose within a lateral price environment. Since
there was no preceding trend to reverse (the doji was in a box
range), it has less significance as a turning signal. One useful
aspect of this doji was that it helped reinforce the resistance
area defined by the bearish engulfing pattern built a few ses-
sions earlier.

Chapter 8 © The Magic Doji 169
¢ Doji 5. A Southern doji. Since it did not confirm any other
bottoming signals, it is not important.
¢ Doji 6. Same as doji 5.
¢ Doji 7. This doji shows how candle lines and patterns must
be viewed in the context of the price activity before that pat-
tern. This doji came after a downtrend. Normally, as detailed
with doji 2, 5, and 6, I would not view a southern doji as a
visual warning of a bottom. However, in the context of the
overall market picture, this doji takes on more significance
since it was confirming support. There was a bullish engulf-
ing pattern at B at 3680 and the hammer on the session before
doji 7 told us the market was building a base near 3680-3682.
That is why this Southern doji at 7 takes on extra conse-
quence, even though it comes after a decline. It was confirm-
ing the dual support area at the bullish engulfing pattern and
| hammer.

Let's look at Exhibit 8.17 to understand why doji should not
be viewed in isolation. This doji following a tall white candle

was also a new high close for the move. Doji or not, a new high
close is a plus. Many traders use "line charts" that are based
solely on the close. The media will say that the stock closed at
a new high. Many Western indicators (moving averages, oscil-
lators, etc.) are keyed on the close. As such, a new high close
keeps the trend up. With this in mind, I normally suggest that
if there is a doji, that is also a new high close for the move to
wait for bearish confirmation of the doji. This confirmation
would be a close the next session under the doji's close. In this
example, we got that bearish confirmation with the next ses-
sion's close. That black candle day was also a failure at our
resistance area defined by the doji's resistance area near $45.50.
THE TRI-STAR

The tri-star is a very rare reversal pattern. As shown in Exhibit
8.18, the tri-star is formed by three doji lines at a new high for
the move. For my candle-charting research, I followed a rule
before revealing a pattern or signal: It had to be corroborated
by at least two independent sources. This helped confirm the
tried-and-true techniques and helped avoid the hundreds of
possible patterns that anyone can think of. (This is why I warn
traders to be careful about other sources of candle-charting
information.)

This tri-star is an exception to my rule of corroboration. I got
this from a single source. It came from a Japanese trader who
used candle charts all his professional career. More important,
he told me his father had found this particular pattern decades
ago and successfully used it. My feeling is that a pattern with
this much history deserved to be included.

The ideal tri-star top has three doji (remember that the plural
of doji is also doji) with the middle doji higher than the first and
second doji. (This is reminiscent of the Western head and shoul-
ders top, where the head is higher than the left and right shoul-

} ders.) In Exhibit 8.19, there are dual hammers during the week

+ + | of January 3. This built a foundation for a rally that gave a hint

| | t i that it was exhausting itself via the doji on January 10. After this
wi-ster Top ri-Star Bottom doji, Honeywell settled into a mostly lateral range, but in doing

not predict moves. As such, while this pattern greatly increased
the chances for a top reversal, it did not forecast the extent of
the potential decline. Note also the tri-star top in Exhibit 8.14 in
mid August.

The water of even a great ocean comes one drop at a time.
; n Part 1 of this book, I examined many candle lines and for-

mations. This chapter is a visual summary. The following
chart has numbered lines and patterns. All are candle indica-
tors that have been discussed previously. How would you
interpret them? If necessary, use the visual Japanese candle
glossary at the back of the book to help you with your inter-
pretations.

Remember, the following interpretations are subjective. You
may see different indicators from those I did, or some that I did
not. As with any charting technique, different experiences will
give different perspectives. There are no concrete rules, just
general guidelines. For example, what if a hammer-like line

had a lower shadow only one and one-half times the height of

the real body instead of the more ideal version with a lower

shadow twice---or even three times---the height of the real
body? A purist might say this was not a hammer and ignore it.

Others may cover shorts on such a line. Still others might wait

for the next session to see what unfolds.

"To hear it told is not equal to experience" is a Japanese
proverb. I can relay basic candle charting techniques, but it will
be only through your experience with these tools, in your mar-
kets, that you will unravel the candles' full potential.

Exhibit 9.1 illustrates the following patterns and lines.

1. A long upper shadow candle. This is a very small clue of the
bulls' hesitation since one session's long upper shadow
doesn't change the directional bias of the market. There is
also not enough history yet to see if the market is over-
bought.

2. The shooting star is now confirming potential resistance at
the aforementioned long upper shadow candle at 1.

3. Yet another long upper shadow candle. Three days of bear-
ish upper shadows from the same highs is certainly enough
reason to stand up and take notice. The candle has the same
shape as a shooting star (that is, a long upper shadow and
small real body at the bottom end of the trading range);
however, a shooting star should come after an ascending
market. Here the market was trading laterally. As such,
while I would not view this as a shooting star, the candle's
long upper shadow is cause for concern since it is confirm-
ing trouble at the shooting star at 2.

4. A falling window further reinforces the bearishness hinted

| at by the long upper shadows at 1, 2, and 3.

5. A small piercing pattern may be some cause for optimism.
However, in the context of the overall technical picture, the
piercing pattern was completed at a resistance area as
defined by the falling window in 4. As such, if one buys
because of this piercing pattern, the trader is buying at resis-
tance. An extended black real body after this piercing pat-
tern puts the bears back in domination.

6. A hammer at 6 hints that the bears' momentum may be
slackening. For the next few days the market was stabilizing
as the low of the hammer held as support---that is, until:

7. The long black real body that closed under the low of the
hammer. This turned the trend southward again. This also
completed a bearish falling three methods pattern.

8. A falling window added more bearish momentum. The doji
on June 10, which opened this window, gave a minor sug-
gestion that the bears are losing some momentum. But doji
normally don't work satisfactorily in downtrends as they do
in rallies. Additionally, the market now has the hurdle of the
falling window as resistance with which to contend.

9. Another long black real body whose upper shadow validat-
ed the falling windows resistance from the prior day. On
June 14, the market very impressively gapped higher on the
open (compared with the prior session's close) and managed
to hold these higher levels into the close of the session. The
two sessions on June 11 and June 14 were a harami pattern.
This neutralized some of the bearish force from the June 11
candle. However, the falling window from 8 is still in force

---

= Wo
176 = Part 1 © The Basics
as illustrated by a long upper shadow session on June 16
whose high was within the window's resistance near 1149/4.

10. The June 17 tall white candle finally pushed this market
above the window's resistance. This turned the trend more
positive. Note also how each session since the June 11 long
black candle had higher highs and higher lows.

11. A small black real body was the first lower high in many
sessions. Additionally, the diminutive black real body,
inside the prior extended white candle, completed a harami
pattern. This hinted that the bulls were losing their breath.
The market descended steadily from there.

12. The lower shadow of this candle was holding support at the
June 11 low near 113.25 and as such provided a small hope
that the market was trying to stabilize.

13. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on whether
you're long or short), this candle line made a new low for
the move, both on an intraday and closing basis. It looked

| like bears were in control until:

14. A doji that was a double plus. First, as a doji within the prior
black real body, it formed a harami cross. More important,
the close back above 113.25 showed that the lows made the
prior day could not be maintained. This would likely lead
shorts to second-guess themselves and give encouragement
to those looking to buy.

15. This white candle gave further bullish impetus to this mar-
ket because, by wrapping around the prior small real body,
it formed a bullish engulfing pattern.

16. The rally from 15 continued unchecked until the small real
body on July 1 made a harami pattern. Interestingly, this
harami pattern, with its extended long white candle and
small black real body, emerged at the same area and looked
similar to the harami pattern a few weeks before at candle
lines 10 and 11.

17. The descent from the harami at 16 visually depicted that the
bears did not have complete control since the minor decline
came with a series of bullish long lower shadow candles.
These candles also had small real bodies.

---

: ---_ ey
Chapter 9 © Putting It All Together 177

18. Another long white candle (a.k.a bullish belt-hold line) at
the same area where another tall white candle appeared on
June 30 gave a foundation for rally. There was another small
black real body the session after this tall white candle. This
small black real body following a tall white real body was
reminiscent of what happened with candle lines 10 and 11
and with a harami at 16. The difference was that this small
black real body (on July 19) was not within the prior tall
white candle. As such, it did not form a harami as was the
case with candle lines 10, 11, and 16. Also, since the black
real body on July 9 did not get deeply into the prior white
real body, it was not a dark-cloud cover.

19. During this time frame, the market was hovering near its
highs of the move. But these small real bodies and the bear-
ish long upper shadows conveyed a sense that the market
was separating from its prior uptrend. This hesitation is not
surprising since 117 was a resistance defined by the falling
window in late May as previously discussed at 4.

20. The white candle wrapping around the black real body has
the correct combination of candle lines to form a bullish
engulfing pattern. However, this was not a bullish engulf-
ing pattern because that pattern, as a bottom turning signal,
must come after a price decline.

21. The white candle on July 26 opening lower and then closing
unchanged from the prior session was a bullish counterat-
tack line. This turned the trend less bearish.

22. The two small white real bodies that gapped slightly higher
from the July 26 candle formed an upgap side-by-side white
candle lines. This was another positive indicator.

23. The August 2 candle broke support at the small rising win-
dow between July 26 and July 27. In spite of the break of the
support, this August 2 candle made a hammer. This provid-
ed potential support near 114 (the hammer's low), which
was confirmed the following day vis-a-vis a dragonfly doji.

24. Although the August 2 candle broke the hammer's support
intraday, by session's end it had managed to close above the
support area and formed a bullish engulfing pattern.

25. An extended black real body took steam out of the market,
but it managed to maintain the support from the low of the

---

178 Part 1 © The Basics
bullish engulfing pattern at 24. The following session,
August 19, this support was broken. However, the market
was now approaching the major support set in the latter
part of June in the 113-112.75 area. As such, the trend is
down. The market is near support, but there are no turning
signals yet.

26. An inverted hammer gives a very tentative clue that the
support near 113 might hold. Nonetheless, because of the
bearish shape of the inverted hammer, one needs to wait for
bullish confirmation the next session with the close over the
inverted hammer's real body to become even marginally
positive. This confirmation came:

27. With a hammer.

28. The white real body of August 13 completed a bullish
engulfing pattern. Consequently, with the inverted hammer
at 26, the hammer at 27, and this bullish engulfing pattern,
we got strong visual reinforcement that June's support near
113 was rock solid.

29. The doji after the tall white candle would be a sign for a bit

| of caution. But, as addressed in Chapter 8, a prime consid-
eration with a doji after a tall white candle (or for any can-
dle signal) is whether the market is overbought or oversold.
Obviously, with this doji marginally off the recent lows, |
would not view this market as being overbought. Hence,
this doji has less implication as a sign of turn.

30. The group of spinning tops throughout the latter part of the
week of August 16 put the trend from up to neutral. The
close via a white candle on August 24 completed a rising
three methods pattern. This pattern formed with the can-
dles from August 17 through August 24.

31. This doji (the real body is so small that, to me, it is the same
as a classic doji) shows the importance of looking at the
overall technical picture. This doji appears in a more over-
bought environment than the doji at 29. Consequently, the
doji at 31 would be viewed as more consequential than the
doji at 29.

32. Because the doji at 31 was still hovering near its highs, I
would prefer further bearish confirmation to buttress the
potential turning signal of this doji. This confirmation came

---

al mmm
Chapter 9 © Putting It All Together 179
with this black real body that closed under the doji's close.
This black real body formed an evening star pattern.
33. This tiny falling window kept the bearish momentum
| intact. There was a minor plus, however. This September 2
candle still maintained the pivotal support near 112.75-113
in force since the latter part of June.

34. A tall white candle that opened almost at the same opening
as the prior candle. As such, this could be viewed as a sep-
arating line. This gave cause for optimism that the support
near 113 was continuing to be solidly sustained. However,
the next day's black candle and failure to maintain this
momentum short-circuited any bullish optimism.

35. A relatively long black real body keeps the bias lower, but
the bulls still have hope since the 112.75-113 support area is
still being sustained.

36. A small white real body that gets above the close of the prior
black real body helps reinforce support near 113. This is not
a piercing pattern since that pattern requires the close of the
white real body be more than the middle of the prior black
real body.

37. The doji on September 16 opened a very small rising win-
dow. Because the market was not overextended, we would
not view this doji as a cautionary signal, especially since
there is potential support at the rising window in the doji
session. Next session, however, the support at the rising
window was penetrated.

38. Using the lows from some of the candle lines from
September 14 to 23, we can now obtain a rising support line.
This aspect of combining the power of trend lines on candle
charts, as well as integrating many other Western technical
signals, is the focus of Part 2.
