Our target for the upthrust was the prior low from where the
rally that took us to the upthrust began. Some may view this as
area 1; others, at area 2. As discussed in Exhibit 11.13 of the
British Pound, this is where subjectivity comes in. I would have
a conservative target at 1 and a liberal target at 2. This upthrust
also shows that it does not have to be an exact resistance area
for this technique to work.

In the prior exhibits the market had closed over resistance
and then retreated the next session to close back under the pre-
viously broken resistance area. Exhibit 11.15 illustrates where
an upthrust unfolds in a single session. In early April, at A,
small real bodies (including a shooting star) showed hesitation
near $30. Another attack on that area at B formed an evening
doji star on April 23, 26, and 27. On May 13 a shooting star pro-
pelled the stock intraday over this $30 resistance. By session's
end the stock showed it was unable to maintain these new
highs as it closed back under resistance. In doing so, it had
formed an upthrust with a target to the immediately preceding
low near $26.25. This objective was reached on May 24 and 25.

In Exhibit 11.16 candle lines at 1, 2, and 3 are maintaining
support near 308.50. On March 1 the bears tried to get a
foothold as they made new lows to slightly under 306. By ses-
sion's end the bears lost control as the index closed above the
previously broken support area of 308.50. Thus, the bears could
not get a beachhead---and a spring was formed. The day of the
spring was also a hammer. Now that we have the spring, we
also have a target. Specifically, this was the high before the
spring was made near 326. Note how at A and B the index got
within a few ticks of this target. This shows how technicals are
subjective. Those who waited to sell at the exact target area
would have been disappointed since it got very close to this tar-
get, but did not touch it.
Exhibit 11.16 showed a spring based on a single session (the
market made a new low and then closed above the broken sup-
port area by session end). Exhibit 11.17 is an example of a
spring formed over a few sessions. A new low close on
February 1 broke an evident support level at $20. The next day
the bulls came back, as the Japanese would express it, "in a
kamikaze attack," and propelled the stock over this broken

support area. In doing so, the stock made a spring. The target is
the most recent high near $23.75 from late January. This January
high was made via a doji following a tall white candle.
Interestingly, the stock hesitated there again with a similar
combination of tall white real body and doji lines on February
9 and 10.

One of the most powerful aspects of technical analysis is that
it helps foster a risk and money management approach to the
market. As such there should always be a price that says we are
wrong about our forecast. In this example, if after the February
2 spring, the market had pulled under the February 1 low, it
would void the target and would be a sign to reconsider long
positions.

THE CHANGE OF POLARITY PRINCIPLE

The Japanese have a saying: "A red lacquer dish needs no dec-
oration." This concept of simple beauty is the essence of a tech-
nical principle I use frequently. It is as simple as it is powerful:

---

206 = Part 2 © Convergence
Old support becomes new resistance and old resistance becomes sup-
port. This is what I call the "change of polarity" principle. Exhibit
Convertedto (11.18 shows support converting to resistance. Exhibit 11.19 illustrates
/ prior resistance becoming new support.
ot sxe The concept behind the change of polarity principle (although not
EXHIBIT 11.18 Change of traditionally called that) is an axiom discussed in many books on tech-
Polarity: Old Support = nical analysis. Yet, it is an underutilized gem. To see how universally
New Resistance well this rule works, let us briefly look at some examples across the
various time horizons and markets.
In Exhibit 11.20 a late December sell-off culminated near $5.35 (at
A). On another test at or near this level, there are at least three groups
Resistance / who could consider buying.

January, some of these old longs who were stopped out would

say to themselves that they were right about silver being in a

bull market. They just timed their original purchase incorrect-

ly. Now is the time to buy. They want to be vindicated in their
original view. They wait for a pullback to support at A or B to

buy. They again go long at C.
¢ Group 3: Those who bought at points A and B. They also see

the rally from B and may want to add to their position if they

get a "good price." At area C, they have their good price
since the market is at support. Thus, more buyers come in at

C. Then, for good measure, another pullback to D draws in

more longs.

Then the problems start for the longs. In late February, prices
puncture support areas A, B, C, and D. A hammer on February
28 is a reason for some optimism, but anyone who bought at
this old support area is now in a losing trade.

What is the most important price in any market? The highs
made for move? The lows? Yesterday's close? No. The most
important price on any chart is the price at which you entered the
market. People become strongly, keenly, and emotionally attached to
the price at which they bought or sold. These longs from $5.35
probably learn prayers in seven languages to get the market
back to breakeven.

Consequently, rallies to anywhere near where the longs
bought (around $5.35) will be gratefully used by them to exit
their longs. Thus, the original buyers at areas A, B, C, and D
may now become sellers. This is the main reason why old sup-
port becomes new resistance as shown by the resistance at E
and F,

A classic example of convergence of technical factors is high-
lighted in Exhibit 11.21. A support area from mid September to
early October near 1435 was breached in early October. A pierc-
ing pattern on October 12 and 13 (in which the white candle
was so strong that it was almost a bullish engulfing pattern)
signaled a rebound. The rally from this piercing pattern took
the S&P to the 1425 area, where we have a series of technical
signals converging including:

1. The bearish engulfing pattern of October 23 and 24.

2. A falling resistance line obtained by connecting the highs
from late September.
3. The resistance area defined by the change of polarity
obtained from a former support level near 1435.
In this instance of convergence, we had a candle signal (the
bearish engulfing pattern) confirming two Western indicators
(a resistance line and change of polarity).
The change of polarity does not necessarily have to be an
exact support area; it can be a zone. In Exhibit 11.22 there was
a region of support (shown by the two horizontal lines) from
$116 to $117.50. Once the lower end of this territory of support
was breached late on April 3, we then use the change of polar-
ity principle. This gives us resistance at prior support in the
aforementioned $116-$117.50 zone. The stock continued its
retreat late on April 3 until a pair of hammers hinted at stabi-
lization. The ascent from these hammers came to an end with
the convergence of the dark-cloud cover and change of polari-
ty on the morning of April 4.

210 Part 2 © Convergence
We see resistance near $111.25 in Exhibit 11.23. Once the bulls
propelled Procter & Gamble over this area, we look for that to
become potential support. Although the series of small real
bodies from noon to late in the session on December 14 kept the
trend neutral. Since $111.25 held as support, the outlook
remained favorable. The last two long lower shadow candles
on December 14 visually confirmed the support near $111.25.
An evident resistance area in Exhibit 11.24 was reinforced by
the March 17 doji. Once the index pushed over this resistance,
we then convert this multitested resistance near 775 into sup-
port. This brings out an aspect about the change of polarity
principle: It usually requires that a support or resistance be test-
ed a few times before we can apply this technique.
A resistance line in Exhibit 11.25 was penetrated in early
February. On the price dip on the week of February 16, we see
a convergence of technical indicators as a hammer on February
20 confirmed a support level based on the change of polarity.
Another price descent ended with another hammer at this same

support area near $29.75. Although the hammer was confirm-
ing support, the hammer doesn't provide a price target. This is
where the Western technicals come into play. We see a resis-
tance line formed from the highs in early to mid April. Using
this line as a potential resistance area, we then have a target if
we buy on the hammer near $31.50. This chart illustrated the
usefulness and advantage of using Western techniques in com-
bination with candles. The Western technicals can confirm a
candle signal (as the hammer confirmed the change of polari-
ty's support) and we can also utilize the Western technicals to
obtain a potential target (the falling resistance line).

All things come to those who wait.
Ma usually do not trend straight up, nor do they fall

vertically down. They often retrace, or correct, some of
their advance, or decline, before resuming the prior trend.
Some of the more popular retracement levels are the 50% level
and the Fibonacci figures of 38% and 62% (see Exhibits 12.1 and
12.2). Fibonacci was a thirteenth-century mathematician who
derived a special sequence of numbers. These ratios include
61.8% (or its inverse of 1.618) and 38.2% (or its inverse of 2.618).
This is why the 62% (61.8% rounded off) and the 38% (38.2%
rounded off) corrections are so popular. The popular 50% cor-

rection is also a Fibonacci ratio. The 50% retracement is proba-
bly the most widely monitored level. This is because the 50%
retracement is by users of Gann, Elliott Wave, or Dow theories.

Let us look at instances where retracements melded with
candle techniques to provide important turning signals.

A bullish engulfing pattern at B held as support with the
bullish long lower shadows on November 21. The rally from 1
to 2 pushed the stock $8 higher. As such, a 50% correction of
this rally is $4 off the highs. This means expected support near
$62.50 (50% of the $8 rally = $4; $4 added to $58.50 = $62.50). On
the approach to this level on November 22, the stock formed a
piercing pattern. As such we got a convergence via a candle
pattern at a 50% retracement level. While retracement levels
can become support or resistance, I would not suggest buying
or selling at a retracement area unless it was confirmed by a
candle pattern as it was here.

Exhibit 12.4 shows a rally from 1 to 2 that took the stock from
$25 to $33.50. A 50% correction of this rally would give poten-
tial support near $29. As the stock was descending from area 2
toward the potential support area, it did so with a series of long
lower shadows that hinted the bears were losing control. The
$29 level was potential support for another reason. Specifically,
if we look at the prior price peaks at A, B, and C, we can use the
change of polarity principle since this broken resistance zone

from $29 to $30 should become potential support. So, there was
a 50% correction in this scenario, along with a change of polar-
ity and converging long lower shadows, thus confirming one
another as the stock approached the $29 area.
We see a decline in Exhibit 12.5 from the price peak in
January at 1 to a bullish engulfing pattern in mid March at 2.
| This low of the bullish engulfing pattern confirmed a hammer
from late February. The rally from the bullish engulfing pattern
| stalled with a high-wave candle almost exactly at a 38.2%
| Fibonacci retracement from the decline from 1 (at $22.65) to 2
(at $22.57). Another reason for resistance in this area was that it
was the November and December former support area. Since
the support area was broken, it then becomes new resistance
based on the change of polarity principle.

_ MOVING AVERAGES

Ten men, ten tastes.

T™ moving average is one of the oldest and most popular

tools used by technicians. Its strength is as a trend-follow-

ing device that offers the trader the ability to catch major

moves. Thus, it is utilized most effectively in trending markets.

THE SIMPLE MOVING AVERAGE

The most basic of the moving averages is, as the name implies,

the simple moving average. This is the average of all the price

points used. For example, let us say that the last five closing

prices of a stock were $38, $41, $36, $41, and $38. The 5-day

moving average of these closes would be:

217

---

218 = Part 2 © Convergence
($38 + $41 + $36 + $41 + $38 = $194 = $38.80)
The general formula is:
(P1 + P2+ P3+P4+P5)
n

where P1 = the most recent price

P2 = the second most recent price and so on

n = the number of data points

The term "moving" in moving average is applicable because,
as the newest data is added to the moving average, the oldest
data is dropped. Consequently, the average is always moving
as the new data is added.

As seen in the simple moving average example above, each
day's stock price contributed 1/5 to the total moving average
(since this was a 5-day moving average). A 9-day moving aver-
age means that each day will only be 1/9 of the total moving
average. Consequently, the longer the moving average, the less
effect an individual price will have on it.

The shorter the term of the moving average, the closer it will
"hug" prices. This is a plus insofar as it is more sensitive to
recent price action. The negative aspect is that it has a greater
potential for whipsaws. Longer-term moving averages provide
a greater smoothing effect, but are less responsive to recent
prices.

Some of the more popular moving averages include the 5-, 9-,
30-, and 50-day moving averages. Probably the most widely
monitored is the 200-day moving average.

The spectrum of moving average users runs from the intra-
day trader, who uses moving averages of real-time trades, to
the hedger, who may focus on monthly, or even yearly, moving
averages.

Other than the length of the average, another avenue of anal-
ysis is based on what price is used to compute the average.
Most moving average systems use, as we did in our prior
example, closing prices. However, moving averages of highs,
lows, and the midpoint of the highs and lows have all been
used. Sometimes, even moving averages of moving averages
are used.

Chapter 13 * Candles with Moving Averages 219

THE WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE
A weighted moving average assigns a different weight to each
price used to compute the average. Almost all weighted moving
averages are front loaded. That is, the most recent prices are
weighted more heavily than older prices. How the data is
weighted is a matter of preference.
THE EXPONENTIAL MOVING AVERAGE
The exponential moving average is a special type of weighted
moving average. Like the basic weighted moving average, the
exponential moving average is front weighted. Unlike other
moving averages, though, the exponential moving average
incorporates all prior prices used in the data. This type of mov-
ing average assigns progressively smaller weights to each of the
past prices. Each weight is exponentially smaller than the previ-
ous weight, hence, the name exponential moving average. One
of the most popular uses of the exponential moving average is
for use in the MACD. The MACD is discussed in Chapter 14.
USING MOVING AVERAGES
Moving averages can provide objective strategies with clearly
defined trading rules. Many of the computerized technical
trading systems are underpinned on moving averages. How
can moving averages be used? The answer to this is as varied
as there are different trading styles and philosophies. Some of
the more prevalent uses of the moving average include:

1. Comparing the price versus the moving averages as a trend
indicator. For instance, a good gauge to see if a market is in
an intermediate-term uptrend could be that prices have to be
above the 65-day moving average. For a longer-term
uptrend, prices would have to be higher than the 40-week
moving average.

2. Using the moving average as support or resistance levels. A
close above the specified moving average would be bullish.
A close below the moving average would be bearish.

---

220 = Part 2 © Convergence

3. Monitoring the moving average band (also known as
envelopes). These bands are a certain percentage above or
below the moving average and can serve as support or resis-
tance.

4, Watching the slope of the moving average. For instance, if
the moving average levels off or declines after a period of a
sustained rise, it may be a bearish signal. Drawing trend
lines on the moving averages is a simple method of monitor-
ing their slope.

5. Trading with dual moving averages. One can compare a
shorter- and longer-term moving average to each other. If the
short-term moving average crosses under the longer-term
moving average, it would turn the trend down. In Japan,
such a crossover is called a "dead cross." When a shorter-
term moving average crosses over a long-term moving aver-
age, the Japanese refer to that as a "golden cross" because it
is viewed as a potentially bullish signal. Some traders will
even take the dual moving averages a step further by saying

| that for a trend to be higher, not only does the short-term
| moving average have to be over the long-term moving aver-
age, but the slope of both moving averages must be up.

Trading with dual moving averages is discussed in Chapter

14.

The following examples use various moving averages.
Generally I have found the 30-day and shorter-term 5-day mov-
ing averages are good gauges for the equity markets. For ;
futures, the 40- and 65-day moving averages are useful. They
are not based on optimum moving averages. An optimum
moving average today might not be the optimum one tomor-
row. The length of the moving averages used in the following
examples are not the important point. What is meaningful is
how moving averages can be melded with candles.

In Exhibit 13.1 we see a moving average that became an
excellent area of support. There may have been times before
August (when this chart begins) in which this moving average
was not so effective as it was during this time. However, once
we determined that the moving average was valid, as it was in
late August and late September, we can then turn our attention
to this particular moving average with the idea that retrace-

ments should hold the moving average as support. With a
downdraft that started with the bearish engulfing pattern the
week of October 11, we would view this moving average as
potential support. As the stock got to this moving average on
October 15, it made a hammer with the white candle after the
hammer completed a bullish engulfing pattern. This conver-
gence of factors (moving average as support, the hammer, the
bullish engulfing pattern) defined the low of the correction
near $48.75. As useful as moving averages are, I would not sug-
gest using a moving average---no matter how often it has suc-
cessfully been defended---as a sole reason to trade. It is much
more important to have a candlestick signal confirming a mov-
ing average's support or resistance before initiating, or offset-
ting, a position.
In Exhibit 13.2 we have a short-term moving average. We can
tell it is a short-term moving average because of how closely it
hugs prices. This happens to be a 9-period exponential moving
average, which is popular among foreign exchange traders. We
could see how well this moving average acted as an upside

resistance area during the decline from mid January on. In early
February through mid February, there were numerous candle-
stick bottoming signals including two piercing patterns and a
bullish engulfing pattern. Nonetheless, resistance at the mov-
ing average remained in force. Consequently, to confirm the
potential bullish implication of these candle signals, one should
wait for a breakout over the resistance area defined by the mov-
ing average. Since this breakout didn't occur, it would keep one
from buying.

Exhibit 13.3 displays a short-term moving average that was
resistance during the descent beginning in mid August. On
August 30 and 31 the stock pushed over this resistance intra-
day, but failed to close above it---thus keeping the trend down.
On September 7 and 8 there was a little whipsaw as the stock
closed above this moving average and then failed. Generally,
however, this moving average (which is a 5-day moving aver-
age) should be respected as resistance because of how well it
worked. Starting September 20 the stock built a series of bullish
long lower shadows with the last long lower shadow candle on
