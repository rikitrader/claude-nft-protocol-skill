# Money Management Rules and Strategies

Now you have the strategies, you know how to analyze the market, when to buy, when to sell, when to exit, and when to stay away from the market. But you are still missing the key to the castle: **the money management plan**.

The most important thing that traders do not talk about is money management. This is what makes the difference between successful traders and losers. If you trade without a money management plan, you are just wasting your time and money, because nothing will work for you even if you have the most powerful trading system in the world.

Most traders focus on how to enter the market, spending months and years looking for the right system. Think differently if you want to become a successful trader.

## Position Sizing

One of the most important components of money management is **position sizing** -- the number of lots you are risking per trade.

### Lot Sizes

| Lot Type | Value Per Pip (approx.) |
|----------|------------------------|
| 1 Standard Lot | $10 per pip |
| 1 Mini Lot | $1 per pip |
| 1 Micro Lot | $0.10 per pip |

### How to Think About Position Sizing

- Think in terms of **dollars risked** instead of pips.
- All forex brokers offer mini lots as the default position size. The smallest value for a mini lot is approximately $1.
- Some brokers offer 10 cents for a mini lot, representing an opportunity for traders with smaller accounts (can begin with $250 and still grow).

### Example

- Trading 3 mini lots of CAD/USD means you bought or sold $30,000 worth of US dollars.
- If the market moves in your favor, you win $3 per pip.
- If you make 20 pips, you profit $60.
- With a 50-pip stop loss and 100-pip profit target: losing = $50; winning = $100.

The size of your position depends on whether you have a standard or a mini account, and how many lots you are trading. This information helps you know how much money you risk on each trade.

## The Risk-to-Reward Ratio

The risk-to-reward ratio concept is what will make you a winner in the long run.

### The Golden Rule

**Never enter a trade in which the profit is less than the amount of money you risked.**

- If you risk $100, your profit target should be at least $200 (a 1:2 risk-to-reward ratio).

### Case Study: 1:2 Risk-to-Reward

Taking 10 trades with 1:2 risk-to-reward ratio, risking $100 each:

| Outcome | Trades | Amount |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Wins (5) | 5 x $200 | +$1,000 |
| Losses (5) | 5 x $100 | -$500 |
| **Net Profit** | | **+$500** |

You do not have to win all your trades to become a successful trader. The risk-to-reward ratio ensures profitability even with a 50% win rate.

### Case Study: 1:3 Risk-to-Reward

Taking 10 trades with 1:3 risk-to-reward ratio, risking $200 each (win $600):

| Outcome | Trades | Amount |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Wins (3) | 3 x $600 | +$1,800 |
| Losses (7) | 7 x $200 | -$1,400 |
| **Net Profit** | | **+$400** |

Even losing 7 out of 10 trades, you are still making money. This is the power of money management.

## The Importance of Stop Loss

All good methodologies use stops. A protective stop loss is an order to exit a long or short position when prices move against you to a specified price.

### Types of Stop Loss

**Initial Stop Loss (Recommended):**

- Placed with your order on the trading platform.
- The trade is closed automatically when the stop loss is hit.
- Allows you to execute your trade and go spend time with your family or friends.
- Helps you trade **out of emotion**, because you know how much you will lose if the market goes against you.

**Mental Stops (Not Recommended):**

- Some traders use mental stops (no stop loss placed), thinking the broker will hit their stop loss -- this is not true.
- The reason behind using mental stops is human psychology: humans hate to lose money.
- If you do not accept losing money as a part of the game, you will never make money in the market.
- **Never use mental stops.** You cannot control the market or be sure where it will go.

### Stop Loss Placement for Price Action Patterns

| Pattern | Stop Loss Placement |
|---------|-------------------|
| Pin Bar | Above/below the long tail |
| Engulfing Bar | Above/below the candlestick pattern |
| Inside Bar | Above/below the mother candle |
| Inside Bar False Breakout | Above/below the break bar |

### Before Every Trade

1. Calculate how much you may **win**.
2. Calculate how much you may **lose**.
3. Place your **stop loss order**.
4. Place your **profit target**.
5. **Forget about your trade.** Let the market tell you if you are right or wrong.

## Capital Risk Rules

### The 2% Rule

Studies have shown that successful traders do not risk more than **2% of their equity** on each single trade.

- If you are a **beginner**, do not risk more than **1%**.
- Do not risk money you cannot afford on a single trade, even if the signal indicates a high-probability setup.
- No matter how smart you are, always think in terms of probabilities.
- You can experience series of losing trades. If you risk too much money, you will not survive.

## Never Risk Money You Cannot Afford to Lose

Trading is a business. You can make money and you can lose it.

### Key Principles

1. The amount you need to start trading depends on the amount you **can afford to lose**.
2. **Never borrow money** or risk big amounts you cannot afford to lose.
3. Trading is all about emotions. If you trade while afraid to lose your account, you will fail because your emotions will control you and affect your trading decisions.
4. You will not be able to follow your trading strategy and will certainly fail.

### The Best Approach

- **Start small.**
- Get as much experience as you can.
- Build slowly your trading account.
- This is how successful traders become successful.

## Entry and Exit Strategy Summary

### Entry

1. Identify the **trend** (uptrend, downtrend, or ranging).
2. Identify the **level** (support, resistance, S&D zones, Fibonacci, MA).
3. Wait for the **signal** (pin bar, engulfing bar, inside bar, or inside bar false breakout).
4. Confirm with **confluence** (multiple factors pointing the same direction).
5. Check the **risk-to-reward ratio** (minimum 1:2).
6. Execute the trade.

### Exit

1. **Stop loss:** Placed at the pattern-specific location (see table above).
2. **Profit target:** The next support or resistance level.
3. **Set and forget:** Do not micromanage. Let the market do the work.

### Emotional Discipline

- If the market goes against you, it is normal. Losing money is emotionally painful -- it is human nature. Nobody wants to lose, especially money.
- In the trading environment, you have to **think differently** and accept that losing is a part of the game.
- When you set your protective stop and your target, do not look back.
- Trading out of your emotions is the key to long-term success.
