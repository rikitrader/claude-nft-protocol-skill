hammer. This hammer held as support. If the stock had pulled
under the hammer's low then, in spite of the positive stochas-
tic reading, one should consider vacating longs.

Exhibit 14.7 shows a series of long lower shadows emerged in
early October. During the week of October 12 we see the
stochastic oscillator in oversold readings near 20% with a
bullish crossover. This reinforced what the bullish shadows had
hinted at, that the stock was stabilizing.

A doji-like line emerged on October 19 following a tall white
candle. This converted the trend from up to more neutral since
the doji hinted that the market was "tired." The market tread-
ed water after this doji and then pushed higher with the
November 2 rising window. This window became support dur-
ing the week of November 2. A bearish engulfing pattern on
November 6 and 9 at B turned the trend less positive. This bear-
ish engulfing pattern had about equally sized real bodies; nor-
mally we like to see a black real body of the bearish engulfing
pattern much larger than the white real body. This shows the
bears have wrested control from the bulls. In this case, howev-
er, at the time of the bearish engulfing pattern, there was also a
bearish crossover in the stochastic reading. As such, when

combined with the stochastic reading, this bearish engulfing
pattern took on extra significance.
MOVING AVERAGE CONVERGENCE----
DIVERGENCE
Constructing the MACD
While the Moving Average Convergence---Divergence (MACD)
is composed of two lines, it is really a combination of three
exponentially smoothed moving averages. The first line is the
difference between two exponential moving averages (usually
the 26- and 12-period exponential moving averages). The sec-
ond line of the MACD is made by taking an exponential mov-
ing average (usually 9-period) of the difference between the
two exponential moving averages used to make the first line.
This second line is called the signal line.
Using the MACD
When the faster line crosses above the slower (the signal line),
it is viewed as a positive. A bearish crossover is when the faster

| line moves under the slower line. The MACD can also be used
to find areas in which the market is overbought or oversold.
Because of the slower nature of MACD, it is not generally used
as a short-term trading tool.

In Exhibit 14.8 the tall white candle on March 16 opened a ris-
ing window. The next day the small real body inside this white
candle formed a harami pattern. The correction from this
harami pattern found stabilization at the aforementioned win-
dow. A dark-cloud cover on March 30 and April 1 at D gave
early evidence that the market, as the Japanese would say, "had
a poor chance of rising." This dark-cloud cover became resis-
tance shown by the action the following two days. While the
stock pushed over the dark-cloud's resistance intraday, it had
failed to close above it, thus keeping the resistance intact.

The week after the emergence of the dark-cloud cover, we get
the bearish confirmation via the MACD as the faster line cross-
es under the slower signal line.

Note how the decline from the dark-cloud cover continued
until the market formed a bullish engulfing pattern in mid
April. This bullish engulfing pattern confirmed the potential
support area at the rising window from March 15 and 16.

This chart is a good example of the value added of candle
charts. Very often candles will give a turning signal ahead of
traditional Western technicals. In this scenario we saw the dark-
cloud cover presaging a top almost a week before the MACD
gave its reversal signal.

In Exhibit 14.9 the S&P made a new high in mid July. But
indications of trouble came with the bearish engulfing pattern
at B. Further dampening the bullish outlook was a bearish clue
sent via the MACD as the faster line crossed under the slower
line. The session after the bearish engulfing pattern, the market
opened a falling window. Because the market had a rising win-
dow the prior week, this falling window built an island top.
This further reinforced the potentially bearish outlook.

In Exhibit 14.10 a large bullish engulfing pattern was com-
pleted on August 3. A few sessions after this, there was a bullish
crossover in the MACD (another example of candles giving an
earlier clue of a reversal than Western techniques). The ascent
from this bullish engulfing pattern continued until the evening
star. (The middle part of the pattern was also a high-wave can-
dle.) A day after this evening star pattern, the nail in the coffin
was placed with the bearish crossover in the MACD.

A single arrow is easily broken, but not ten in a bundle.
O™ of the most important clues sent out by the market is
volume. Volume is like water pressure in a hose. The
greater the water pressure, the more powerful the water flow.
Likewise, the stronger the volume, the more the force behind
the move.
Volume should increase in the direction of the trend to
improve the likelihood that the current trend should continue.
If, however, volume declines as a trend progresses, there is less
reason to believe the trend will continue. Volume can also be
useful for confirming tops and bottoms.
While specific volume measurements, such as On Balance
Volume and Open Interest, are not addressed in this chapter,

whichever forms of volume analysis you now use will help
enhance the effectiveness of candle charts.

I'm frequently asked at my seminars about combining vol-
ume with candle charts by changing the width of the candles
according to their volume. That is, the higher the volume, the
wider the real body. In my opinion, it is just as easy to read vol-
ume classically---on the bottom of a chart. The disadvantage to

. adjusting the thickness of the candle line with volume is that if
there are many high-volume sessions, there will be fewer can-
dle charts that can fit on the screen. Volume is so important that
however you choose to display it is not important. What is
important is that if it is available, you should use it.

Because volume numbers are different from market to mar-
ket, I don't look at an absolute volume figure, but at relative
volume. In other words, in one stock 50,000 shares could be an
extraordinarily high-volume session---while, in another, 10 mil-
lion shares might be light volume. As such, I look for relative
volume spikes in a market.

In Exhibit 15.1 we can see how this stock had a volume spurt
late on May 3. We see that compared with preceding sessions,
this was an abnormal volume. As such, we should pay atten-
tion to it. This high-volume session was also a hammer. This is
what we like to see---volume confirming price.
This chart brings out another aspect. A very long lower shad-
ow hammer means that by the time the hammer is confirmed
(we need to wait for a close to confirm the hammer), the mar-
ket could be well off its lows. Buying at the close of such a ham-
mer may not present an attractive risk/reward since the market
may retrace back to the lows of the hammer before, potentially,
resuming an upward course. A high-volume hammer, such as
in this chart, decreases the chance for a correction to the ham-
mer's low. Therefore, one may be more aggressive about buy-
ing on the hammer's close if it is a usually high-volume ham-
mer than one would if the volume didn't give the same force-
ful confirmation.

momentum. A single session, on November 11, changed the
technical picture. That session's spinning top completed the
second session of the harami pattern. However, of greater con-
sequence was that spinning top's strong volume. This showed
that as heavy as the supply was (and we know there was heavy
supply because of the high volume), the demand was strong
enough to keep the bears in check---hence, the small real body.

The market rallied from this harami. On the next sell-off later
in November, the stock stabilized with a piercing pattern. With
the piercing pattern, we would like to see lighter volume on the
black candle and heavier volume on the white candle. This
would serve to reinforce that the bears are losing force and the
bulls are gaining a stronger foothold. This scenario of lighter
volume black and heavier volume white is what unfolded in
Capital One. This volume scenario also increases the odds that
the piercing pattern will hold. In this example, the piercing pat-
tern's support was well defended with the December 15 ham-
mer.

This concept of volume confirming the candle pattern can be
used for any candle signals. For instance, this would mean that
a bearish engulfing pattern should have a lighter volume on the
first candle (the white) and a heavier volume on the second
candle (the black) to increase the bearish engulfing pattern's
significance.

Adding the insights of volume to the power of a falling or ris-
ing window is, as the Japanese proverb says, "Like the right
hand helping the left." In Exhibit 15.3, the market formed a
bullish harami cross the week of May 8. A few sessions later a
tiny rising window opened between May 13 and 15. This
diminutive window was support throughout the week of May
15. On May 22 an expanded rising window opened. This win-
dow also had the bullish kicker of extra heavy volume. While a
rising window is viewed as potential support, a high-volume
window enhances its effectiveness as support (or, in the case of
a falling window, as resistance). A bullish long lower shadow on
June 1 was confirmation of the bulls' force as the stock held the
$30 support area on a close (as defined by the bottom of the May
22 window).

While a small real body is a clue that a decline or advance
may be exhausting itself, if we add high volume to a small real

body, we get more substantiation of a turn. Let's look at Exhibit
15.4 to describe why this is so. In this chart of Dell I circled a
high-volume day (at 1) on August 18, which was also a rising
window. As examined in Exhibit 15.3, a high-volume rising
window should be a solid support area. This was the case with
Dell as shown by the action a few days after the rising window.
Another unusually large volume session occurred October 19
(at 2). The day was also a doji. This high-volume doji was sig-
nificant insofar as it came after a steep decline that took Dell to
a support area at the early August bullish engulfing pattern
(that had a hammer as the first candle line). As discussed in
Chapter 8, I usually pay less attention to doji in declines than
advances. However, since this doji corroborated a support area
and had large volume, I certainly would stand up and take
notice of it. What this high-volume doji evidenced was that
there was heavy supply (as proven by the high volume); but
with the stock forming a doji, it proved that the demand was
strong enough to absorb the supply. On October 19 we thus

have a convergence of technical factors underscoring the
importance of $37.25 as support:
1. A support area based on the lows of the August bullish
engulfing pattern.
2. The doji.
3. The expansive volume on the doji displaying all the heavy
supply was being absorbed.

Note how this support was again successfully defended the
week after the doji with a tall white candle.

The same theory about a high-volume doji during a decline
increasing the chance of a turn compared with a regular vol-
ume session is true even if the candle is a small real body. (We
saw a high-volume spinning top in Exhibit 15.2.) To summarize
integrating high volume with spinning tops or doji:

1. An unusually high-volume doji or spinning top after an
extended advance illustrates that the bulls' drive is being

met with enough supply to stall the rally. This is a possible

top reversal.

2. A very heavy-volume doji or small real body during a steep
decline shows that heavy supply is being taken by the equal-

ly aggressive demand.

Whether there is a single candle line or a group of candles
forming a pattern, the chances of a turnaround are increased if
volume confirms what the candle pattern is showing. Exhibit
15.5 shows a bullish engulfing pattern late on October 5. The
first part of the bullish engulfing pattern was a spinning top
that hinted the previous downdraft was losing some steam.

The next session's long white candle showed the bulls had
grabbed control. Adding to the bullish impetus of this bullish
engulfing pattern was that the first part of this pattern was
lighter volume as compared with the long white candle's vol-
ume. This convergence of volume and bullish engulfing pattern
reinforced one another and increased the likelihood of a turn.

dles with bearish upper shadows at $72.50. This confirmed
resistance from the prior session's long upper shadow at the
same level.

As a general rule we can say that the longer the white candle,
the more probable a continuation of a rally. But volume adds
another important dimension to this. As illustrated in Exhibit
15.6, an extended white candle line on May 12 pushed the stock
to a new high. However, mitigating some of this bullishness is
this candle's light volume. When a market creates a new high,
we would like to see that confirmed by a push in volume. In
this case, volume didn't corroborate the breakout. Although
lack of volume on an upside breakout wouldn't convert me
from a bull to a bear, it is a reason to be more circumspect. This
is because such a low-volume rally increases the chances that it
will not be sustained. In this stock, the candle after the May 12
low-volume tall white candle was a long black one and, as
such, reinforced the lack of the bulls' control.

nl charts, because they provide an x-ray into the

demand/supply situation, are potent in calling early turn-
ing signals. Assuming one enters a trade with a candle signal
(preferably with confirmation with other candle or Western sig-
nals), the challenge becomes knowing when to exit.

My firm, candlecharts.com, utilizes different exit strategies,
depending on the client's trading style. One method we use is
forecasting price objectives from classic Western patterns. There
is another reason for incorporating measured targets. No matter
how ideal a candle pattern or how many reversal signals con-
verge at one area, it doesn't predict the extent of the reversal.
This is where we shift to Western technicals for price objectives.

250 ~---- Part 2 © Convergence

The measuring techniques in this chapter will illustrate a few
of these many patterns, including breakouts from a box range,
swing targets, flags and pennants, and ascending and descend-
ing triangles.

Price targets are not synonymous with support or resistance.
For example, if there is an upside objective of $42, this does not
mean the rally will stop at $42 (of course, it may not even get
to $42). In my opinion, one should not look at a price objective
to initiate a new position, but to offset an outstanding position.
In the example discussed above, I would use a rally to the $42
area to liquidate longs, but not to initiate a new short position.
Of course, if there were a bearish candle signal or a conver-
gence of other technical signals, hinting that $42 was an area of
resistance, one could then be more aggressive about consider-
ing a sale.

BREAKOUTS FROM BOXES

Most of the time, the markets are not in a trending mode but
rather in a lateral range, what the Japanese call a box range. On
such occasions, the market is in a relative state of harmony with
neither the bulls nor the bears in charge. The Japanese word for
tranquility and calm is "wa." I like to think of markets that are
bounded in a box range as being in a state of "wa."

When a market is in a box, it is like a coiled spring ready to
unwind when the surrounding pressure is released. We can use
this potential pent-up energy. When a breakout from box range
unfolds, the market has good potential continuing in the direc-
tion of the breakout.

As shown in Exhibit 16.1, a move outside the box implies a
move at least equal to the vertical height of the box. Specifically,
on a push above the top end of the box (bullish breakout), one
takes the vertical measurement from the bottom end of the box
(the support area) to the top end of the box range (the previous
resistance). This distance is shown as A-B. We derive a target
by adding this A-B range onto the prior resistance area. As an
example, an upside breakout from a $50-$53 box range would
give a $56 target.

The opposite would be a penetration of a box range's sup-
port (shown as a bearish breakout in Exhibit 16.1). If we used

target
EXHIBIT 16.1. Breakout from Boxes
the same $50----$53 box range, a bearish break of this support at
$50 would provide a $47 target.

In Exhibit 16.2 there's a box range environment with the top
end at areas 1 and 2. The bottom end of the box (the support

| zone) is delineated by the two horizontal lines between 3600
and 3500 (we will discuss area A in a moment).

The top at 1 did not have any candlestick reversals. This illus-
trates that not all reversals are signaled with candles. The top at
2 was an ideal version of an evening star since none of the three
real bodies that comprise this pattern touched. Additionally,
the high point of 2 was a hanging man line that was confirmed
the next session.

Once the NASDAQ failed from area 2, we can say that as a
failure from the prior high at 1, it could retreat to the low made
between the highs at 1 and 2. This low was the bullish engulf-
ing pattern at A. As such, we have a price target toward 3600-
3500. This area held in the latter part of September via a couple
of tall white candles near 3600.

The early October rupturing of this support did double dam-
age. First, the long black real body of October 2 punctured the
bottom end of the bullish engulfing pattern at A and thus broke
a support area. Perhaps of more consequence was that once the
bottom end of the large box range of 4250 to 3500 was broken,
it gave us a target toward 2750. This measurement was
obtained by taking the 750 points (from the high to low of the
box range) from the bottom end of the box near 3500. This tar-
get was met a few months later.

EXHIBIT 16.2. NASDAQ Composite Index---Daily (Downside Breakout from a
Box)

We can see by the move under this target of 2750 that price tar-
gets do not necessarily mean a support area. This is a very impor-
tant point to consider. Just because the NASDAQ got to 2750 does
not mean that one should buy because it got to a target.

This chart also highlights a reason I like box breakouts. Once
a support area is penetrated, we can then use the change of
polarity principle (see Chapter 11) to define what should
become resistance. Based on this technique, the prior support
(in this example, 3600-3500) should be converted into resis-
tance. That is what unfolded here. If the index had closed back
above 3600, it would have voided my downside target of 2750.

Exhibit 16.3 shows a clearly defined lateral range from $66.25
to $67.75. The candle line at A breaches this support line, but
since it did not close below it, the support was still intact. At B
the market closed under its box range. This was the bearish sig-
nal. We got earlier clues of a stock in trouble before the break at
B with the downward sloping resistance line shown on the
chart. This increased the likelihood that the support level at
$66.25 would eventually break.
