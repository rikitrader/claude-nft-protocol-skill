# Chapter 12 Candles Retracement

September 24 as a hammer. While these candle lines gave a
visual clue that the market was groping for a bottom, it took the
September 25 close to get final bullish confirmation as this can-
dle completed a bullish engulfing pattern and closed above this
moving average. Note how this moving average held as sup-
port on the late September rally and as resistance during the
early October decline.

Exhibit 13.4 displays how a moving average can become sup-
port and resistance. On the initial ascent on the week of May 8,
natural gas ascended and maintained this moving average's
support (shown at the arrows). On July 5 the moving average's
support was penetrated with a falling window. Consequently,
we now have two reasons for resistance. The first is the moving
average. Since this average worked so well as support, it
should be expected to act equally well as resistance. Second, a
falling window between $4.29 and $4.41 should also be resis-
tance. In early July, natural gas got to this moving average's
resistance but failed to close over it. The early July rally was
also a failure of the window's resistance zone.

Uns pattern recognition techniques that are subjective
(this includes candlestick techniques), oscillators are
mathematically derived techniques that offer a more objective
means of analyzing the market. They are widely used and are
the basis of many computerized trading systems.
Oscillators include such technical tools as the relative
strength index, stochastics, and MACD. The three major uses of
oscillators are:
1. As a divergence indicator. There are two kinds of divergence. A
negative, or bearish, divergence occurs when prices are at a
new high, but the oscillator is not. This implies the market is
internally weak. A positive, or bullish, divergence is when

prices are at a new low, but the oscillator does not hit a new

low. The implication is that the selling pressure is losing

steam.

2. As overbought/oversold indicators. This means oscillators can
notify the trader if the market has become overextended and,
thus, vulnerable to a correction.

3. As confirmation of the force behind a trend's move. Oscillators can
confirm the market's momentum, measuring the velocity of
a price move by comparing price changes. In theory, the
velocity should increase as the trend is under way. A flatten-
ing of momentum could be an early warning that a price
move may be decelerating.

There is a Japanese saying: "All clouds do not rain." I view
the oscillator as a rain cloud that has the potential for rain---but
the only way to tell it's raining is either seeing or feeling the

| raindrops. So it is with oscillators. An oscillator is like a storm
| cloud, but we need a final confirmation with candle signals.

Thus, I view an overbought or oversold oscillator as only a

warning, a clue, with final confirmation coming with a candle-

stick pattern.

THE RELATIVE STRENGTH INDEX

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is one of the most popular

oscillators. The RSI oscillator is different from the concept of the

relative strength. The relative strength compares the relative
strength performance of a stock, or a small group of stocks, with
the performance of a sector or a broader market index such as

the Dow Jones or the S&P 500.

Computing the RSI

The RSI compares the relative strength of price advances to

price declines over a specified period. Nine and 14 days are

two of the most popular periods used. The RSI is figured by
comparing the gains of up sessions with the losses of the down
sessions over a given time frame. The calculations used are
dependent only on closing prices. The formula is:
RSI = 100 --- (100/(1 + RS))
where RS = ---average up points for period
average down points for period

Thus, computing a 14-day RSI entails adding the total gains
made on the up days over the last 14 days (on a close-to-close
basis) and dividing by 14. The same would be done for the
down days. These figures provide the relative strength (RS).
This RS is then put into the RSI formula. This RSI formula con-
verts the RS data so that it becomes an index with a range
between 0 and 100.

Using the RSI
The two main uses of RSI are as an overbought/oversold indi-
cator and as a tool to monitor divergence.
e As an overbought/oversold indicator, the RSI implies that
the market is overbought if it approaches the upper end of
| this band (that is, above 70%). At that point, the market may
be vulnerable to a pullback or could move into a period of
consolidation. Conversely, at the lower end of the RSI range

(usually below 30%), it is said to reflect an oversold condi-

tion. In such an environment, there is a potential of a short

covering move.

¢ As a divergence tool, RSI calculations can be helpful when
prices make a new high for the move and the RSI fails to
make a concurrent high. This is called negative divergence
and is potentially bearish. Positive divergence occurs when
prices make a new low, but the RSI does not. Divergence is
more meaningful when RSI oscillator readings are in over-
bought or oversold regions.

In Exhibit 14.1, through the later part of November there was
resistance near $58. Once Albertson's pushed over that level
with a tall white candle on December 1, we can then use the
change of polarity that converts the prior resistance into new
support. There was vacillation the week of December 14, but a
series of bullish long lower shadows showed that this stock had
a good foundation near $62. The rally resumed on December
21, stalling with a dark-cloud cover. As the stock formed this
dark-cloud cover at new highs, the RSI was overbought and
also formed a negative divergence signal. That is, the stock's
price was higher at 2 than 1, but the RSI was lower at 2 than 1.
The aforementioned dark-cloud cover became resistance as
confirmed by another dark-cloud cover made on January 10
and 11. A piercing pattern in mid January at P occurred in an
oversold environment (as gauged by the RSI).
