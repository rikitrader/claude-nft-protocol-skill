ogy, it is a three river bottom in which the middle river is the
Three Crows longest.

Three crows---Three relatively long consecutive black candles
that close near or on their lows. It is a top reversal at a high-
price level or after an extended rally.

Three methods---There are two types. The first is the falling three
methods, which is a bearish continuation pattern. It is ideally

ie Rng comprised of five lines. A long black real body is followed by
| bo + | three small, usually white, real bodies that hold within the
i | | ‘ first session's high-low range. Then a black candlestick clos-
es at a new low for the move. The rising three methods is a
bullish continuation pattern. A tall white candlestick pre-
Three Mountain T° cedes three small, usually black, real bodies that hold within
| the white candlestick's range. The fifth line of this pattern is
a strong white candlestick that closes at a new high for the
move.
hres River bo Three mountain top---A longer-term topping pattern in which
prices stall at, or near, the same highs.
Three river bottom---When the market hits a bottom area three
times.

Three white or three advancing soldiers---This is a group of three

Three White Soldiers white candlesticks with consecutively higher closes (with
each closing near the highs of the session). These three white
candles presage more strength if they appear after a period of
stable prices or at a low price area.

Thrusting line---A white candlestick that closes in the prior
black real body, but still under the middle of the prior ses-
sion's real body. The thrusting line is stronger than an in-
neck line, but not so strong as a piercing line. In a downtrend,
the thrusting line is viewed as bearish (unless two of these
patterns appear within a few days of each other). As part of
a rising market, it is considered bullish.

Towers---Thetre is a tower top and a tower bottom. The tower top, a Towers
top reversal formation, is comprised of one or more tall white i, "en f
candles followed by congestion and then one or more long f i | 1
black candlesticks. It is a pattern that looks like it has towers I
on both sides of the congestion band. A tower bottom is a bot-
tom reversal pattern. One or more long black candles are fol-
lowed by lateral action. Then the market explodes to the
upside via one or more long white candlesticks.
Tri-star---Three doji that have the same formation as a morning sweezers
or evening star pattern. An extraordinarily rare pattern. i meres
Tweezers top and bottom---When the same highs or lows are test- |* | i i LL. i 4
ed on back-to-back sessions. They are minor reversal signals
that take on extra importance if the two candlesticks that
comprise the tweezers pattern also form another candlestick
indicator. For example, if both sessions of a harami cross
| have the same high, it could have more. significance since
there would be a tweezers top and a bearish harami cross
made by the same two candlestick lines. Umbrella Lines
Umbrella lines---The generic name for the hammer and hanging
man lines. The umbrella line looks like an umbrella since it is
a candle with a long lower shadow and a small real body at,
or near, the top of the trading range.
Upper shadow---See Shadows.
Upside gap tasuki---See Tasuki gaps.
Upside gap two crows---A three-candlestick pattern. The first line
is a long white candlestick that is followed by a black real
body that gaps over the white candle's real body. The third
session is another black real body that opens above the sec-
ond session's open and closes under the second session's windows
close. It is very rare. a. \
Window---The same as a Western gap. Windows are continua- i i
tion patterns. When the market opens a window to the ing uy
upside, it is a rising window. It is a bullish signal and the ris-
ing window should be support. If a window opens in a sell-
off, it is a falling window. This is a bearish signal. The falling
window is resistance.

Te glossary is to clarify the Western technical terms used in
this book. It is not meant to be comprehensive or detailed,
as this book focuses on Japanese candlesticks, not Western
technicals.
Bar chart---A graphic representation of price activity. The high
and low of the session define the top and bottom of a vertical
line. The close for the period is marked with a short horizon-
tal bar attached to the right of the vertical line. The open is
marked with a short horizontal bar attached to the left of the
vertical line. Price is on the vertical scale; time is on the hori-
zontal scale.
Blow-offs---A top or bottom reversal. Blow-offs occur after an
extended move. Prices sharply and quickly thrust strongly in
the direction of the preceding trend. If the market reverses
after this action, it is a blow-off.
Box range---The Japanese term for a market in a lateral trading
range. See Congestion zone or band.

Breakaway gap---When prices gap away from a significant tech-
nical area (i.e., a trend line or a congestion zone).

Breakout---Overcoming a resistance or support level.

Change of polarity---When old support converts to new resis-
tance, or when old resistance converts to new support.

Confirmation---When more than one indicator substantiates the
action of another.

Congestion zone or band---A period of lateral price action within
a relatively narrow price band. The Japanese call this a box
range.

Consolidation---The same as a congestion zone. Consolidation,
however, has the implication that the prior trend should
resume.

Continuation pattern---A pattern whose implications are for a
continuation of the prior trend. A flag, for instance, is a con-
tinuation pattern.

Crossover---When the faster indicator crosses above (bullish
crossover) or below (bearish crossover) the slower indicator.
For example, if a 5-day moving average crosses under a 13-
day moving average, it is a bearish crossover.

Divergence---When related technical indicators fail to confirm a
price move. For instance, if prices reach new highs and
stochastics do not, this is negative divergence and is bearish.
If prices establish new lows and stochastics do not make new
lows, this is called positive divergence and is bullish.

Double bottom---Price action that resembles a W in which price
declines twice stop at, or near, the same lows.

Double top---Price action that resembles an M in which price ral-
lies twice stop at, or near, the same highs.

Downgap---When prices gap lower.

Downtrend---A market that is trending lower as shown by a
series of lower highs and/or lower lows.

Exponential moving average---A moving average that is exponen-
tially weighted.

Falling resistance line---A resistance line made by joining a series
of lower highs.

Falling support line---A support line obtained by connecting a
series of lower lows.

Fibonacci---Italian mathematician who formulated a series of
numbers based on adding the prior two numbers. Popular
Fibonacci ratios used by technicians include (rounding off)

38%, 50%, and 62%.
Flag or pennant---A continuation formation comprised of a
sharp price move followed by a brief consolidation area.
| These are continuation patterns.
Gap---A price void (i.e., no trading), from one price area to
another.

Inside session---When the entire session's high-low range is
within the prior session's range.

Intraday---Any period shorter than daily. Thus, a 60-minute
intraday chart is based on the high, low, open, and "close" on
an hourly basis.

Islands---A formation at the extremes of the market when prices
gap in the direction of the prior trend. Prices then stay there
for one or more days, and then gaps in the opposite direction.
Prices are thus surrounded by gaps that leave them isolated
like an island.

Measured moves---A price target based on using measurements
formulated on prior price action.

Momentum---tThe velocity of a price move. It compares the most
recent close to the close a specific number of periods ago.

Moving average convergence---divergence (MACD) oscillator---A
combination of three exponentially smoothed moving aver-
ages.

Neckline---A line connecting the lows of the head in a head and
shoulders formation, or the highs of an inverse head and
shoulders. A move under the neckline of a head and shoul-
ders top is bearish; a move above the neckline of an inverse
head and shoulders neckline is bullish.

Negative divergence---See Divergence.

Oscillator---A momentum line that fluctuates around a zero
value line (or between 0% and 100%). Oscillators can help

| measure overbought/oversold levels, show negative and

| positive divergence, and measure a price move's velocity.

Overbought---When the market moves up too far, too fast. At
this point the market is vulnerable to a downward correction.

Oversold---When the market declines too quickly. The market
becomes susceptible to a bounce.

Paper trading---Not trading with real money. All transactions
are only imaginary with a record of profit and loss on paper.

Pennant---See Flag.

Positive divergence---See Divergence.

Rally---An upward movement of prices.

Reaction---A price movement opposite of the prevailing trend.

Relative Strength Index (RSI)---The RSI compares the ratio of up
closes to down closes over a specified time period.

Resistance level---A level where sellers are expected to enter.

Retracement---A price reaction from the prior move in percent-
age terms. The more common retracement levels are 38.2%,
50%, and 61.8%.

Reversal indicator---See Trend reversals.

Reversal session---A session when a new high is made for the
move and the market then closes under the prior session's
close.

Rising resistance line---A resistance line made by connecting
higher highs.

Rising support line---A support line connecting higher lows.

Selling climax---When prices push sharply and suddenly lower
on heavy volume after an extended decline. If the market
reverses from this sharp sell-off, it is viewed as a selling cli-
max.

Selloff---A downward movement of prices.

Simple moving average---A method of smoothing price data in
which prices are added together and then averaged. It is a
"moving" average because the average moves. As new price
data is added, the oldest data is dropped.
