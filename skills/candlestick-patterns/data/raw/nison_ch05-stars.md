EXHIBIT 5.5. Merrill Lynch---Daily (Morning Star)
Let's use the intraday chart in Exhibit 5.6 to see an instance
of the value of being flexible in interpreting the candle patterns.
Mid-day on December 27 the index made a new low for the
move and in doing so broke under the support from early that
day of 3535/3530. The bears thus took control. But at 13:00 a
small real body and the next session's long white candle made
a morning star. Notice how all three bodies touched one anoth-
er (the open of the second candle was the same as the close of
the first candle and the open of the third candle was the same
as the close of the second session). Because this was an intraday
chart where the open/close difference is usually minor, I still
viewed this as a viable morning star. This pattern took on more
credibility since the third candle, which finalized this pattern,
also pushed the index back above the previously broken sup-
port area near 3530. When a market makes a new low and the
bears can't maintain these new lows, it is frequently a hint of a
reversal.

THE EVENING STAR
The evening star is the bearish counterpart of the morning star
pattern. It is aptly named because the evening star (the nick-
name for the planet Venus) appears just before darkness sets in.
Since the evening star is a top reversal, it should be acted upon
if it arises after an uptrend. Three lines compose the evening
star (see Exhibit 5.7). The first is a long white real body, the next
is a star. The star is the first hint of a top. The third line corrob-
orates a top and completes the three-line pattern of the evening
star. The third line is a black real body that closes sharply into
black or the first period's white real body. I like to compare the evening
4 white star pattern to a traffic light. The traffic light goes from green
' ‘ 3 (the bullish white real body) to yellow (the star's warning sig-
nal) to red (the black real body confirming the prior trend has

| | stopped).

| | | In principle, an evening star should have a gap between the
| | | first and second real bodies and then another gap between the
EXHIBIT 5.7. Evening second and third Tea bodies But, as detailed earlier in the sec
Star tion on the morning star, this second gap is rarely seen and is

not necessary for the success of this pattern. The main concern 2 _clsland Top
should be the extent of the intrusion of the third day's black cep. | Teen
real body into the first day's white real body. ‘| F
At first glance Exhibit 5.7 is like an island top reversal as 1
used by Western technicians. Analyzing the evening star more | |
closely shows it furnishes a reversal signal not available with |
an island top (see Exhibit 5.8). For an island top, the low of ses- island Top Western
sion 2 has to be above the highs of sessions 1 and 3. However,
the ideal evening star only requires real body 2 to be above the
high of real bodies 1 and 3 to be a reversal signal.
Some factors increasing the likelihood that an evening or
morning star could be a reversal would include:
1. If there is no overlap among the first, second, and third real
; bodies.
| / 2. If the third candle closes deeply into the first candle's real
vo body.
3. If there is light volume on the first candle session and heavy
volume on the third candle session. This would show a
reduction of the force for the prior trend and an increase in
the direction force of the new trend.
The highs of the evening star become resistance as displayed
by the dashed line shown in Exhibit 5.7.
Let's look at Exhibit 5.9. A classic evening star was complet-
ed in early January. This evening star had the ideal prerequisite
of the three real bodies not intersecting. Intersecting the star
portion (that is, the second candle line of the evening star pat-
tern) was a hanging man line whose bearish confirmation came
the next day. The descent from the evening star culminated a
week later near 1210 at area A. The rally from A hesitated a
week later via a doji near the resistance area created by the
evening star. This doji hinted the rally was exhausting itself.
(Dojis are discussed in Chapter 8.)
The next time the market rallied to this resistance in the first
week of February, it formed a bearish engulfing pattern at B. I
mention this bearish engulfing pattern to bring out the impor-
tance of trend in helping to define a candle pattern. I have dis-
cussed how a bearish engulfing pattern is when a black real body
engulfs a white real body. There was a black real body at A that

A HISTORICAL NOTE
The full name of the evening and morning star patterns are the three-
river evening star and the three-river morning star. | originally
thought they were termed "three-river" evening and morning stars
because each of these patterns had three candle lines, hence three
rivers. | discovered that the origin is much more fascinating.
Nobunaga Oda, a major military figure of the late sixteenth century,
was one of the three military leaders who unified feudal Japan (see
Chapter 2). He fought a seminal battle that occurred in a very fertile
rice-growing province. Since rice was a gauge of wealth, Nobunaga
was as determined to wrest this area as fervently as the owners were
to defend it. This fertile rice area had three rivers. The heavily
defended area made it difficult for Nobunaga to cross these three
rivers. Victory was his when his forces finally forded these three
rivers. Hence the names "three-river" morning and evening stars
reflect a time when, if these patterns are formed, it will be difficult to
/ get through these three rivers once they are formed. That is, the
/ __ bullish three-river morning star should be important support and the
: | bearish three-river evening star should be pivotal resistance. Yet, vic- _
wrapped around a prior white candle. Was this a bearish engulf-
ing pattern? No, because it came after a price decline; whereas a
bearish engulfing, as a top reversal, needs a rally to reverse. This
is why I define B as a bearish engulfing pattern, but not A.
Another doji in late February echoed continued supply near
the evening star's resistance level. The long black candle after
this doji formed another evening star pattern. This evening star
had a doji as a second candle line instead of a spinning top. This
is a special type of evening star called an evening doji star, which
is discussed later in this section. The second evening star is an
example where the second and third candles overlapped. From
my experience this works as well as the more classic pattern in
which none of the real bodies touch.
A challenge with some of the candle patterns is that by the
time the pattern is completed, the market may be well off its
highs or lows. The evening star, because of the need to wait for

---

Chapter 5 © Stars 69
its completion with a long black real body, may give a reversal
signal well after the market has already turned. We look at this
aspect in Exhibit 5.10.

As shown in this chart, the high of the move was near $34,
with the evening star's completion on the close of the third ses-
sion at $31. As such, if one sold based on the evening star at $31,
the risk would be to the high of evening star toward $34. There
is no problem with a $3 risk if the target is many times that risk.
Only then would it be an attractive risk/reward trade.

If this $3 risk is too large, one can improve the risk/reward
aspect of this trade by waiting for a bounce to near the resis-
tance area at the top of the evening star (of course, there is no
guarantee of a bounce). In this example, two sessions after the
evening star we got a $2 rebound which took the stock very
close to its pivotal resistance at $34. After this stock resumed
its decline, it moved into the April-May period. The shrinking
real bodies presaged that chances for a turnaround had
increased.

THE MORNING AND EVENING DOJI STARS
An evening star that has a doji instead of a small real body as
the second candle is called an evening doji star (see Exhibit 5.11).
+ The evening doji star is a distinctive form of the regular
\ evening star. We saw an example of this pattern in Exhibit 5.9.
l I A morning star that has a doji as the star portion (ie., the
| | middle candle of the three candle lines) is a morning doji star
| (see Exhibit 5.12). This type of morning star can be a meaning-
EXHIBIT 5.11. Evening ful bottom.
Doji Star If there is an evening doji star in which the bottom shadow of
the doji session does not overlap with the shadows of the first
| or third candles (that is, the shadows do not touch), it is con-
| | sidered a top reversal signal known as an abandoned baby top
| | L | (see Exhibit 5.13). This pattern is very rare.
| I The same is true, only in reverse, for a bottom. Specifically, if
+ there is a doji that has a gap before and after it (where the shad-

top or bottom where the island session would be a doji. i i
Because the middle line of the morning star in Exhibit 5.15 l | | l
was a doji, this is an example of a morning doji star. Here we | |
see how the third candle line slightly overlapped the second
real body (i.e., doji line). The ascent from this morning doji star EXHIBIT 5.13.

ran out of force with the series of spinning tops (a.k.a. small real
bodies). As is the case with the traditional morning star, the
lowest low of the morning doji star (in this case near $92) |
should act as a base on pullbacks. That is what happened in | | |
mid October as the morning doji star held its ground as sup- | |
port. The doji portion of the morning star had long upper and iy i

, mark" is a round $100 figure that can become support or resis-
* tance) and then the failure to push over the resistance area of
this pattern a few days later (via a long upper shadow candle)
helped substantiate this as an evening doji star. This $400 level
. remained an upside barrier over the next few weeks with the
- long black real body on November 30 providing the "death
blow" in forming a bearish engulfing pattern.

In Exhibit 5.17 an evening doji star pattern formed in late

February. Because the market gapped before and then after the

doji, this pattern was an abandoned baby top. Also troubling

about this particular scenario was the third day's abandoned
-, baby (gapped down). This showed the prior day's new high
a close above $56 could not be sustained. When a new high is
a made and the bulls can't maintain the new highs, it often had
bearish consequences. This is discussed in Chapter 11.

The ideal abandoned baby bottom has a doji as the second
real body. In Exhibit 5.18 there was a diminutive real body as
the second session instead of the requisite doji needed for the
ve ideal abandoned baby. However, the real body was so small

that it could be viewed as a doji and thus a variation of this pat-
tern (this second session was also a hammer). The advance
from this bottom reversal persisted until a series of longer
upper shadows (at the arrows) alerted us that the bulls were
not calling all the shots. This further buttressed the outlook that
the market had hit a ceiling. A rebound commenced after the
bullish engulfing pattern of April 6 and 7.
THE SHOOTING STAR AND
THE INVERTED HAMMER
As shown in Exhibit 5.19, the shooting star has a small real body
at the lower end of its range with a long upper shadow. We can
| see how this line's name is derived. It looks like a shooting star
| with its long tail blazing across the sky. The Japanese aptly say
. that the shooting star shows trouble overhead. Since it is one
. session, it is usually not a major reversal signal as is the bearish
engulfing pattern or evening star. Nor do I view the shooting
star as pivotal resistance as I do with the two previously men-
tioned patterns.

As with all stars, the color of the real body is not important.
The shooting star pictorially tells us that the market opened
near its low, then strongly rallied and finally backed off to close
near the opening. In other words, that session's rally could not
be sustained.

Since the shooting star is a bearish reversal signal, it must
come after a rally. An ideal shooting star has a real body that
gaps away from the prior real body. Nonetheless, as will be
seen in several chart examples, this gap is not always necessary.
A lack of a rising gap is more of a reason to be negative on the
shooting star. This is because, as addressed in Chapter 7, an

| ascending gap, called a "rising window" in Japan, is a positive
7 White or Black : :
signal. As such, I am more comfortable saying the trend could
| | be turning less bullish if the shooting star has no gap. If a shoot-
| | | | ing star-shaped candle line comes after a downturn, it could be
a bullish signal. Such a line is called an inverted hammer. The
EXHIBIT 5.19. Shooting inverted hammer line is discussed later in this chapter.

| The Shooting Star
If Exhibit 5.20 were formed as a bar chart instead of a candle
chart, sessions A, B, and C would reflect a healthy environment
because they each had higher highs, higher lows, and higher
closes. But from a candle charting perspective, we get visual
warnings with these sessions of trouble overhead. Specifically,
the bearish upper shadows at A, B, and C strongly indicate a
stock that is, as the Japanese say, "rising in agony." Final con-
firmation of a top came at session C, the shooting star. You may
have noticed that a gravestone doji looks like a shooting star.
The gravestone doji is a specific version of a shooting star. The
shooting star has a small real body but the gravestone doji---
being a doji---has no real body. The gravestone doji is thus more
bearish than a shooting star.
In Exhibit 5.21, the first shooting star---in what was to be a
/ series of shooting stars---arose on March 10 at $34.50. A few
: weeks later, three consecutive shooting stars appeared at this

same $34.50 level. This told us that try as they might, each time
the bulls had been able to push the stock up to $34.50, they
couldn't sustain these intraday highs into the close. In other
words, the shooting stars were visually showing us that the
market was rejecting higher prices. When, as in this example,
we get signal after signal at the same price level, it reinforces
that resistance area. In this case the confluence of shooting stars
dramatically increased the likelihood that this would be a
reversal. Of course, if the bulls had enough force to close this
stock over the highs of the shooting stars, then we would
reassess any bearish views.

A shooting star early on August 22 in Exhibit 5.22 reinforced
trouble near $304 since it was the third consecutive session that
failed there. The 30-minute period following the shooting star
gave more proof of a top since it produced a bearish engulfing
pattern. Corning then settled into a box range defined by the
support of the hammer at $294 from late on August 23 (which
was successfully defended with another hammer early the next

day). The rally from the second hammer at $294 hit a ceiling
with the shooting star's resistance near $304.
The Inverted Hammer
While not a star pattern, I want to discuss the inverted hammer
in this section because of its resemblance to the shooting star.
Exhibit 5.23 demonstrates how an inverted hammer has the
same form as a shooting star with its long upper shadow and
small real body at the lower end of the range. The only differ-
ence between the shooting star and inverted hammer is that the
inverted hammer comes after a decline. As a result, while the
shooting star is a top reversal line, the inverted hammer is a | |
bottom reversal line. The color of the inverted hammer's real | | |
body doesn't matter. This is similar in concept to the hammer | |
and hanging man concept (see Chapter 4) in which the same _--- White or Black
shape line is bullish or bearish depending on the preceding EXHIBIT 5.23. Inverted
trend. Hammer

---

le Ee |
78 Part 1 © The Basics

Just as a hanging man needs bearish confirmation, the invert-
ed hammer needs bullish confirmation. This confirmation
could be in the form of the next day opening above the invert-

| ed hammer's real body or especially a close the next day over
the inverted hammer's real body.

The reason for the required bullish verification of the invert-
ed hammer is because its long upper shadow gives the invert-
ed hammer a bearish hue. To wit, on the inverted hammer ses-
sion the market opens on, or near, its low and then rallies. The
bulls fail to sustain the rally and prices close at, or near, the
lows of the session. Why should negative action like this be a
potentially bullish reversal signal? The answer has to do with
what happens over the next session. If the next day opens, and
especially closes, over the inverted hammer's real body, it
means those who shorted at the opening or closing of the
inverted hammer are losing money. The longer the market
holds above the inverted hammer's real body, the more likely
these shorts will cover. This could spark a short covering rally
that could lead to bottom pickers going long. This could feed
upon itself with the result being the beginning of a rally.

EXHIBIT 5.25. Oil Service Index---Daily (Inverted Hammer)

On May 24 in Exhibit 5.24, a hammer generated support at
$76. The next day an inverted hammer formed. This was a new
low close for the move, and as such kept the short-term trend
pointing down. However, the hammer's support was still being
maintained. The May 26 close accomplished two plusses: It
once again confirmed the hammer's support and it provided
bullish confirmation of the inverted hammer since it was a
close over that line's real body. If more bullish confirmation
was needed of the solidity of support at $76, it came on June 2
with another hammer.

A bearish engulfing pattern in mid June in Exhibit 5.25 devel-
oped into resistance a few days later. The descent from this fail-
ure at resistance near $82 culminated with an inverted hammer.
This line was confirmed by a higher opening the next day, and
especially with that session's higher close. The rally from this
inverted hammer continued into the week of July 12 when a
shooting star implied that the bearish engulfing pattern's resis-
tance was still in force.

Put a lid on what smells bad.
M ost of the reversal formations in Chapters 4 and 5 are
comparatively strong reversal signals. They show that
the bulls have taken over from the bears (as in the bullish
engulfing pattern, a morning star, or a piercing pattern) or that
the bears have wrested control from the bulls (as in the bearish
engulfing pattern, the evening star, or the dark-cloud cover).
This chapter examines more reversal indicators that are usual-
ly, but not always, less powerful reversal signals. These include
the harami pattern, tweezers tops and bottoms, belt-hold lines,
the upside-gap two crows, and counterattack lines. This chap-
ter then explores more potent reversal signals that include three
black crows, three mountains, three rivers, dumpling tops, fry-
pan bottoms, and tower tops and bottoms.

THE HARAMI PATTERN
|
| ( \ | | Spinning tops (that is, small real bodies) are components in cer-
| or i ba" tain formations. The harami is one of these formations (the star,
| _ examined in Chapter 5, is another). The harami pattern (see
EXHIBIT 6.1. Harami Exhibit 6.1) is a small real body that is contained within what
the Japanese call "an unusually long black or white real body."
"Harami" is an old Japanese word for pregnant. The Japanese
nickname for the long candle is the "mother" candle and the
small candle is the "baby" or "fetus." The second candle of the
harami can be white or black. If, for example, both the first and
second candles of the harami are white, it would be expressed
as "white---white harami."
| The Japanese will say that with a harami the market is "los-
ing its breath." The bearish harami displays a disparity about
the market's health. Specifically after a bull move, the long
white real body's vitality is followed by the small real body's
uncertainty. Additionally, the small real body opening and clos-
ing within the prior open---close range is another indication that
the bulls' upward drive has weakened. Thus, a trend reversal is
possible. During a bear move, the selling force reflected by a
long black real body is followed by the second day's vacillation.
This could portend a trend reversal since the second day's
small real body is an alert that the bears' power has diminished.
The combination of candle lines in the harami pattern, with
its first tall real body followed by a small real body, is the
reverse of the engulfing pattern. In the engulfing pattern, a
lengthy real body engulfs the preceding small real body.
Another difference between the harami and engulfing pat-
terns is that for the two candles of the engulfing pattern, the
color of the real bodies should be opposite. This is not neces-
sary for the harami. You should find, however, that in most
instances, the real bodies in the harami are oppositely colored.
The harami formation is comparable to the Western inside
day. For a Western inside day (see Exhibit 6.2), the entire range
of the second session has to be within the entire range of the
first session. This is not necessary for harami. For harami all
1 that is required is that the second real body be within the first
: real body, even if the shadow of the second day is above or

on the left of Exhibit 6.1. On the second session the upper shad-
ow moved over the prior white real body. This is still a harami | { ! |
because the second session's real body was contained within | |
the first real body. | | i t
Harami Cross
EXHIBIT 6.3. Harami
The regular harami has a tall real body followed by a small real Cross
body. Yet, there are no rules as to what is considered a "small"
candle. This, like many other charting techniques, is subjective.
As the general principle, the more diminutive the second real
body, the more potent the pattern. This is usually true because
the smaller the real body, the greater the ambivalence and the
more likely a trend reversal. In the extremes, as the real body
becomes smaller as the spread between the open and close nar-
rows, a doji is formed. A doji preceded by a long black real
body during a decline (or a tall white real body during a rally)
is a distinctive type of harami referred to as a harami cross
(Exhibit 6.3).
The harami cross, because it contains a doji, is viewed as a
more potent reversal signal than the regular harami pattern by
the Japanese. The harami cross is sometimes referred to as the
petrifying pattern. My best guess as to why it has that nickname
is that the preceding trend has been frozen or petrified in
preparation for a reverse move. A harami cross occurring after
a very long white candle is a pattern a long trader ignores at his
or her own peril. Harami cross can also call bottoms, but they
seem more effective at tops.
Exhibit 6.4 shows a brisk rally that started October 26. The
third white candle of this rally on October 31 pushed the index
over the October 23-24 bearish engulfing pattern's resistance
(at B). However, whatever cause for optimism the bulls had on
the 31st was short-lived as a harami pattern was completed
with the November 1 candle. That candle's real body was so
small that it could be considered a harami cross. The series of
spinning tops after the harami reinforced that the trend had
changed from up to neutral. The long black candle on
November 8 completed a tower top (see later in this chapter).
In Exhibit 6.5 a price drop that began with the hanging man
found a floor with the harami of November 4 and 5. The second
real body of this harami was so small that I viewed it as a doji.

Chapter 6 © More Reversal Patterns 85
As such, this is a harami cross. What was especially significant
about the emergence of this pattern was that it helped clearly
confirm a defined support near $61 (shown by the horizontal
support line). If this were a bar chart, we would have the same
support based on the action from early to late September.
Although we're using a candle chart, we can and should use
traditional bar chart support or resistance areas. Thus, there
was an Eastern signal (harami) confirming a traditional
Western signal (support line).

There was an earlier harami cross pattern on September 29
and 30. With this harami the short-term trend changed up to
lateral. This pattern highlights an important point---one that
was addressed in the introduction to Chapter 4: When a trend
changes it doesn't necessarily mean that prices will go from,
say, up to down. In both harami in this exhibit the former
uptrend did change after the appearance of the harami. In the
November harami, the trend shifted from down to up and in
the September harami from up to neutral. As such, both harami
correctly forecasted a change of trend.

We are all detectives in the market as we pick up the small
visual clues the market continually sends out. As these clues
unravel, we may have to adjust our market stance. Exhibit 6.6
is an example of this. On April 19 this stock pushed above resis-
tance with an extended white candle. With this bullish break-
out, the signs pointed north. The next day, the texture of the
market had changed with the harami. While this harami
doesn't immediately convert the short-term trend from up to
down, it was a visual alarm. As such, longs can be scaled back,
protective stops moved higher, etc. The doji after the harami
(on April 24) helped reinforce that the trend had moved from
up to more neutral since the doji represents a time where the
bulls and bears are in equilibrium. The descent from this
harami continued until a bullish engulfing pattern (the first ses-
sion of this pattern was a hammer). The rally from the bullish
