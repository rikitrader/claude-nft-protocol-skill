EXHIBIT 16.3. JOS Uniphase---5 Minutes (Downside Breakout from a Box)

Once support gave way with candle line B, we know (from
the change of polarity) that this old support, $66.25, converts
into resistance. So, now we have a resistance area, but what is
our downside potential? For this we use the vertical distance of
the $66.25-$67.75 box range and subtract that $1.50 from the
bottom end of the trading range, giving us a target toward
$64.75.

The S&P, as shown in Exhibit 16.4, was in a trading range

between the 1090 area (at B) and 1140 (at A). The bulls pro-
pelled this index above the 1140 resistance on June 24. Adding
this A---B (50-point) span onto 1140 gave us a price projection of
1190. This target was exceeded marginally as the stock ascend-
ed along a rising resistance line (see Chapter 11). There are a
couple of high-wave candles near 1200. (A high-wave candle
has extended upper and lower shadows and a small real body.
It is related to a long-legged doji, except that a long-legged doji
has a doji instead of the small real body, as described in Chapter
8.) These high-wave candles gave a sense that the market was
losing its sense of direction (which heretofore was up).

Chapter 16 ® Measured Moves 255

Exhibit 16.5 shows that Texas Instruments was locked in a
$130-$145 box. When it approached the top end of this range
on February 17 and 18, it formed a bearish engulfing pattern.
This pattern should be resistance. However, the next session
(February 22) got above this resistance. This was a bullish
breakout pushed over the bearish engulfing pattern's resistance
and also penetrated the top end of a box. This implied a price
target toward $160 (based on the previous $15 range).

What would tell us we were wrong about this target? If, once
the market got above $145, as it did on September 22, it got
back down under $145 on a close, such a scenario would negate
this target. In other words, once the market makes a new high,
it is important for the bulls to show they have control by sus-
taining the new highs.

SWING TARGETS, FLAGS, AND PENNANTS
| Swing targets, flags, and pennants are comprised of three seg-
ments:
1. An initial cleanly defined brisk move.
2. A correction of the move.
3. Aresumption of the move in the same direction as the initial
move.

We will look at swing targets first and then flags and pen-
nants.

The theory behind the swing target (see Exhibit 16.6) is that
if the market advances, or declines, vigorously, and then there
is a retracement of this move, the next leg of the move should
be at least equal to the move of the previous channel.

This is shown in Exhibit 16.6 where the height of the first leg
is a rally from A to B. There is then a correction to C. Once the
market ascends from C, we would "swing" the initial channel
height of A to B onto the correction low at C. Hence, the name
"swing target."

Swing targets are very similar in concept to flags and pen-
nants. The major difference is that corrections in a swing target
are more substantial than flags or pennants. As shown in
Exhibit 16.7, flags are lateral, or small countertrend, moves after

a clearly defined sharp advance or decline. This congestion
band serves to relieve an overbought (in a rally) or oversold (in
a decline) condition. If, after this short-term correction, the mar-
ket resumes its prior trend, we then have a flag or pennant pat-
tern.

The difference between flags and pennants is that in a flag,
the "flag" portion is a horizontal box range. In a pennant pat-
tern, the "flag" portion (i.e., the congestion band) looks like a
pennant because it has lower highs and higher lows.

Exhibits 16.7 and 16.8 show the measurements of the bull and
bear flags and pennants. Their measuring implications are built
on the same concept as that of the swing target. For the flag or
pennant pattern, we use the vertical height of the initial
advance or decline---nicknamed the "flagpole."

In Exhibit 16.7 we see bull flag and pennant's price targets
are derived by adding the height of the initial sharp advance
(the flagpole) from A to B onto the bottom end of the congestion
band (which is either a flag or pennant shape). The more tradi-

tional method is adding this flagpole's height to the top of the
flag or pennant. I prefer to err on exiting too early rather than
missing the last few ticks. As such, my measurement starts
from the bottom of the flag or pennant rather than the top.

As shown in Exhibit 16.8, the bear flag or pennant objective
is forecasted by subtracting the flagpole (A---B) range from the
top of the congestion band. (Again, this is my subjective con-
servative target---others will use the more classic measurement
from the bottom of the congestion band.)

In Exhibit 16.9 there is an almost vertical rally from 1 to 2 that
took the stock from $22.50 to $27.50. The decline from 2 to A
was almost exactly a Fibonacci 61.8% correction of this rally.
(See Chapter 12 for discussions on retracements.) The stock
started its advance from A.

Using the 1 to 2 rally and the correction to A, we can obtain
a swing target by taking the $5 move from 1 to 2 and adding
that to the correction low of A at $ 24.50. This gives a potential
target to $29.50.

While measured moves do not only normally become resis-
tance or support, in this example we see how a bearish engulf-

ing pattern (at B) on February 1 and 2 emerged at this project-
ed $29.50 price target.

In Exhibit 16.10 we see that after the ascent from A to B, the
stock took a breather for about a week. During this time the
market moved into a box range between $36.50 and $37.75. A
rising window opened on July 11 (after candle line C) and pro-
pelled the stock above the aforementioned lateral trading
range.

From a candlestick perspective, this rising window did two
things: First, it turns the trend north, and second, this window
now becomes potential support. While this window gives us a
positive bias, it does not provide an upside target. For this, we
shift to the Western technicals. Looking at the rally from A to B
and the correction to C, we have a bull flag pattern. Now we
can get a target by adding the "flagpole" portion (A to B) to the
bottom of the "flag" (at C). The A to B rally is about $ 5.50.
Putting this onto the low at C gives an upside target toward
$42. (As mentioned above, most books on Western technical
analysis will add this $5.50 to the top of the flag portion [near

$38], but I use the more conservative measurement of the bot-
tom of the flag [$36.50] portion of a bull flag.)

As the stock approached our conservative $42 target, a shoot-

ing star arose overhead, making the target a resistance area. The
black candle after the shooting star completed the third line
needed for an evening star pattern. The descent from there
found support in late July near $37.75. This was a support area
defined by the rising window on July 14 with the inverted ham-
mers. The rally that started the week of July 28 hesitated at the
high of the aforementioned evening star pattern at around $42.
As discussed with an evening star (and many other candle pat-
terns), I normally look at resistance based on the close. Thus,
when the stock pushed above the evening star's resistance
intraday, but failed to close above it, this resistance remained
intact.

Exhibit 16.11 highlights two shooting stars at A. This denotes
hesitation near the 925-950 area. The steep fall from A to B hes-
itated with a long-legged doji at B. From there, the index
ascended slightly. This helped mitigate what was an oversold

condition. By looking at the A to B decline as a flagpole and the
triangular range at B and C as a pennant, we have a bear pen-
nant formation.

Once the bottom end of the pennant was broken, we can
derive a target by taking the decline from A to B from the minor
correction high at C near 775. This gives a downside target
toward 525 which was exceeded.

A variation of a piercing pattern arose near 500 at P. It was a
variation because the white candle did not get more than
halfway into the black real body. However, since this was the
first white candle and higher close of the entire decline from C,
I would still view this variation as important as a classic pierc-
ing pattern. This outlook was validated the following week by
the successful defense of the piercing pattern's support.

There are many types of triangles in Western technicals: sym-
metrical triangles, wedges, and so on. As shown in Exhibit
16.12, there are ascending and descending triangles.

The ascending triangle has a horizontal resistance area tested
numerous times. Moves down from this resistance are at
sequentially higher lows. This exemplifies that, although there
is supply at the resistance line, demand is getting more aggres-
sive as the market pulls back from this resistance area. If the
bulls can then push the market over the horizontal resistance,
we have an ascending triangle. The measurement is the height
