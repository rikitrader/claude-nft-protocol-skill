# Candlestick Patterns

Candlestick patterns are one of the most powerful trading concepts. They are simple, easy to identify, and very profitable setups. Research has confirmed that candlestick patterns have a high predictive value and can produce positive results.

Candlestick patterns are the language of the market. If you know how to read candlestick patterns the right way, you will be able to understand what these patterns tell you about the market dynamics and traders' behavior. This skill will help you enter and exit the market at the right time.

> **Key Principle:** Focus on the anatomy of each pattern and the psychology behind its formation. Understanding *why* a pattern forms is more important than memorizing its name.

## Candlestick Anatomy

### What is a Candlestick?

Japanese candlesticks are formed using the **open**, **high**, **low**, and **close** of the chosen time frame.

- If the **close is above the open**, the candlestick is **bullish** (the market is rising). Bullish candlesticks are typically displayed as white/green.
- If the **close is below the open**, the candlestick is **bearish** (the market is falling). Bearish candlesticks are typically displayed as black/red.
- The **filled part** of the candlestick is called the **real body**.
- The thin lines above and below the body are called **shadows** (or wicks/tails).
- The top of the upper shadow is the **high**.
- The bottom of the lower shadow is the **low**.

### Body Sizes

- **Long bodies** refer to strong buying or selling pressure. A bullish candlestick with a long body means buyers are stronger and taking control. A bearish candlestick with a long body means sellers control the market.
- **Short and small bodies** indicate little buying or selling activity.

### Shadows (Tails)

- **Upper shadows** signify the session high.
- **Lower shadows** signify the session low.
- Candlesticks with **long shadows** show that trading action occurred well past the open and close.
- Candlesticks with **short shadows** indicate that most trading action was confined near the open and close.
- A **longer upper shadow with short lower shadow** means buyers bid price higher, but sellers came in and drove price back down near the open.
- A **long lower shadow with short upper shadow** means sellers forced price lower, but buyers came in and drove prices back up near the open.

## The Engulfing Bar Pattern

The Engulfing Bar is formed when a candle fully engulfs the previous candle. The engulfing bar can engulf more than one previous candle, but at least one candle must be fully consumed. This pattern consists of two bodies where the second body engulfs the first.

### Bearish Engulfing

- The first body is smaller than the second one; the second body engulfs the previous one.
- This pattern tells us that **sellers are in control** of the market.
- When it occurs at the end of an **uptrend**, it indicates that buyers are engulfed by sellers, signaling a **trend reversal**.
- You cannot trade any bearish engulfing pattern alone; you need other technical tools to confirm entries.

### Bullish Engulfing

- The bullish engulfing bar consists of two candlesticks: a small body followed by the engulfing candle.
- This pattern tells us that the market is no longer under control of sellers, and **buyers will take control**.
- When it forms in the context of an **uptrend**, it indicates a **continuation signal**.
- When it forms at the end of a **downtrend**, the reversal is much more powerful as it represents a **capitulation bottom**.
- The color of the bodies is not important. What matters is that the smaller one is totally engulfed by the second candlestick.

## The Doji Pattern

The Doji is one of the most important Japanese candlestick patterns. When this candlestick forms, it tells us that the market opens and closes at the same price, indicating **equality and indecision** between buyers and sellers. No one is in control of the market.

### Key Characteristics

- The opening price is the same as the closing price.
- When this pattern occurs in an uptrend or a downtrend, it indicates that the market is **likely to reverse**.
- A Doji indicates equality and indecision in the market. It is often found during periods of resting after big moves higher or lower.
- When found at the bottom or top of a trend, it is a sign that the prior trend is **losing its strength**.
- If you are already riding that trend, it is time to take profits.
- It can also be used as an entry signal if combined with other technical analysis.

## The Dragonfly Doji Pattern

The Dragonfly Doji is a **bullish** candlestick pattern formed when the open, high, and close are the same or about the same price. It is characterized by a **long lower tail** that shows resistance from buyers and their attempt to push the market up.

### Key Characteristics

- The long lower tail suggests that the forces of supply and demand are nearing a balance and that the direction of the trend may be nearing a major turning point.
- When it occurs in a **downtrend**, it is interpreted as a **bullish reversal signal**.
- Helps you visually see where support and demand are located.
- You cannot trade this pattern alone; you need other indicators and tools to determine high-probability dragonfly Doji signals.

## The Gravestone Doji Pattern

The Gravestone Doji is the **bearish version** of the Dragonfly Doji. It is formed when the open and close are the same or about the same price. It is characterized by a **long upper tail**.

### Key Characteristics

- The formation of the long upper tail indicates that the market is testing a powerful supply or resistance area.
- While buyers were able to push prices well above the open, sellers later overwhelmed the market, pushing the price back down.
- This is interpreted as a sign that **bulls are losing their momentum** and the market is ready for a reversal.
- For this pattern to be reliable, it must occur near a **resistance level**.
- You need additional information about placement and context to interpret the signal effectively.

## The Morning Star Pattern

The Morning Star is a **bullish reversal pattern** that often occurs at the bottom of a downtrend. It consists of three candlesticks:

### Structure

1. **First candle:** Bearish, indicating sellers are still in charge.
2. **Second candle:** A small candle (can be bullish, bearish, or a Doji) representing that sellers are in control but unable to push the market much lower.
3. **Third candle:** A bullish candlestick that gaps up on the open and closes above the midpoint of the body of the first day, holding a significant trend reversal signal.

### Interpretation

- Shows how buyers took control of the market from sellers.
- When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend near a support level, it is interpreted as a **powerful trend reversal signal**.
- The first candle confirms seller domination, the second produces indecision, and the third bullish candle indicates buyers took control.

## The Evening Star Pattern

The Evening Star is a **bearish reversal pattern** that usually occurs at the top of an uptrend. It is the bearish version of the Morning Star. It consists of three candlesticks:

### Structure

1. **First candle:** Bullish, indicating bulls are still pushing the market higher.
2. **Second candle:** A small candlestick (can be bullish, bearish, or a Doji), showing buyers are still in control but not as powerful.
3. **Third candle:** A large bearish candle indicating the buyer's domination is over and a possible bearish trend reversal.

### Interpretation

- The trend that created the first long bullish candlestick is losing momentum.
- The final candlestick gapping lower indicates confirmation of the reversal and the beginning of a new downtrend.

## The Hammer (Pin Bar)

The Hammer candlestick is created when the open, high, and close are roughly the same price. It is characterized by a **long lower shadow** that indicates bullish rejection from buyers and their intention to push the market higher.

### Key Characteristics

- It is a **reversal candlestick pattern** when it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend.
- This candle forms when sellers push the market lower after the open, but get rejected by buyers, so the market closes higher than the lowest price.
- The long shadow represents high buying pressure from that point.
- Sellers were trying to push the market lower, but the buying power was more powerful than the selling pressure, resulting in a trend reversal.
- The most important thing to understand is the **psychology behind the formation** of this pattern.

## The Shooting Star (Bearish Pin Bar)

The Shooting Star is formed when the open, low, and close are roughly the same price. It is characterized by a **small body and a long upper shadow**. It is the bearish version of the Hammer.

### Key Characteristics

- Professional technicians say the **shadow should be twice the length** of the real body.
- When this pattern occurs in an **uptrend**, it indicates a **bearish reversal signal**.
- The psychology is that buyers tried to push the market higher but got rejected by selling pressure.
- When this candlestick forms near a **resistance level**, it should be taken as a high-probability setup.
- It indicates the end of the uptrend move and the beginning of a new downtrend.
- It can be used with support and resistance, supply and demand areas, and with technical indicators.
- It is one of the most powerful signals for entering the market.

## The Harami Pattern (Inside Bar)

The Harami pattern (meaning "pregnant" in Japanese) is considered both a **reversal and continuation pattern**. It consists of two candlesticks:

### Structure

- **First candle:** The large candle, called the **mother candle**.
- **Second candle:** A smaller candle called the **baby**, which closes inside the first bigger candle.

### Key Characteristics

- For the Harami pattern to be valid, the second candle should close outside the previous one.
- It is a **bearish reversal signal** when it occurs at the top of an uptrend.
- It is a **bullish signal** when it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend.
- The Harami candle tells us that the market is in an **indecision period** (consolidating). Buyers and sellers do not know what to do, and no one is in control.

### Trading Rules

- When this pattern happens **during** an uptrend or downtrend, it is interpreted as a **continuation pattern**, providing a good opportunity to join the trend.
- When it occurs **at the top** of an uptrend or **at the bottom** of a downtrend, it is considered a **trend reversal signal**.

## The Tweezers Tops and Bottoms

### Tweezers Top

The Tweezers Top formation is a **bearish reversal pattern** seen at the top of an uptrend.

- Consists of two candlesticks: a bullish candlestick followed by a bearish candlestick.
- Occurs during an uptrend when buyers push the price higher, giving the impression the market is still going up, but sellers surprised buyers by pushing the market lower and closing down the open of the bullish candle.
- Indicates a **bullish trend reversal** when combined with other technical tools.

### Tweezers Bottom

The Tweezers Bottom formation is a **bullish reversal pattern** seen at the bottom of a downtrend.

- Consists of two candlesticks: a bearish candlestick followed by a bullish candlestick.
- Happens during a downtrend when sellers push the market lower, but the next session price closes above or roughly at the same price of the first bearish candle, indicating buyers are coming to reverse the market direction.
- If this occurs near a **support level**, it indicates that a bearish reversal is likely to happen.
- The bears pushed the market downward on the first session; however, the second session opened where prices closed on the first session and went straight up, indicating a **reversal buy signal**.

## General Principles

1. **Do not focus on the name** of a candlestick. Try to understand the **psychology behind its formation** -- this is the most important thing.
2. If you understand *why* it was formed, you will understand what happened in the market and can easily predict the future movement of price.
3. **Never trade candlestick patterns alone.** You will always need other technical tools and factors of confluence to confirm your entries.
4. **Practice identifying patterns** on your charts. With screen time and practice, you will be able to look at your charts and understand what the candlesticks tell you about the market.
