Close and candlesticks interchangeably throughout the rest of the

EXHIBIT 3.7. Examples of The Japanese say the real body is "the essence of the price
Doji movement." This reflects a central concept about the power of
the real bodies: By looking at the height and color of the real
body, we get an immediate visual clue whether it's the bulls or
bears who are in control.

As such, candle charts will make market analysis faster and
more efficient. Using the long white candle in Exhibit 3.4 as an
example, who is in charge? The bulls or bears? Obviously, it's
the bulls since on that session the market opened near its low
and closed near its high. Likewise, a long black candle (Exhibit
3.5) is a visual representation that, at least for that session, the
bears were in control since the market opened near its high and
closed near the session lows.

Candle lines can be drawn using any time frame---from
intraday to daily to weekly charts. For example, a white candle,
as shown in Exhibit 3.4, if based on a daily chart, would mean
that the bottom of the real body is the first trade of the day
(remember, a white real body signifies the open is at the bottom
of the real body) and the top of the real body is the day's close.
The intraday peak and trough are the tip of the upper shadow
and the bottom of the lower shadow, respectively.

Similarly, a five-minute black candle line tells us that the
open of that five-minute period is at the top of the black real
body and the close is at its bottom. The high and low of that
five-minute session will define the upper and lower shadows.

A practical application of the real body is using its size as a
barometer of the market's momentum.

While a long white and black candle shows the action is one-
sided, we get a clue that the prior momentum may be losing
force as the real body becomes smaller. The Japanese term for a
small real body (black or white) is a spinning top. Exhibit 3.6
shows examples of spinning tops. The lines illustrated in
Exhibit 3.6 have upper and lower shadows, but the sizes of the
shadows are not important. It is the small size of the real body
that makes these spinning tops.

Spinning tops are components of candle formations includ-
ing morning and evening stars, harami, hammers, and others
that will be discussed at length in the appropriate sections.

Notice something about the real bodies in Exhibit 3.7? There
aren't any! These lines are named doji (the plural of doji is also
doji) and they represent a session when the open and close are
the same (or very close to one another). Doji have implications
as a reversal signal. We will look at this aspect later in this chap-
ter and in greater detail in Chapter 8.

In Exhibit 3.8, during the week of April 1 a descent began
near 315 via a series of black candles. As the decline ensued the
real bodies increased in length, reflecting increasing bearish
momentum. The emergence of the spinning top on April 7
changed the technical picture from one in which the bears had
complete control to a market where the bears were losing dom-
ination. Since the small real body was only one session's activ-
ity, it should be viewed as a tentative clue. Nonetheless, it was

| the first sign of a potential reversal. This represents a major
advantage of candle charts: They will often let you spot poten-
tial market turns as quickly as one session.

While the April 7 spinning top was a candle signal, it also
helped confirm a traditional western technical analysis tool---
specifically, a rising support line constructed by connecting the
March 10 and March 23 lows. Thus, we have two signals, the
support line and spinning top, reinforcing support near 285.
This concept of combining Eastern and Western techniques will
be the focus of Part 2.

Another example of a spinning top hinting of a turn is the
point where the decline from 315 began---the April 2 spinning
top (remember, the color of the small real body is not impor-
tant) that followed a tall white candle (at which time the bulls
were in control).

One of the fascinating aspects of the candles is that they can
send out warning signals not evident on bar charts. For example,
look at the prior chart in Exhibit 3.2 and the rally the week of
January 18. Notice the two candles lines as the stock approached
the $60 level. If this was a bar chart, this stock would look
healthy since it was making higher highs, higher lows, and even
higher closes. However, the candle lines give us a different per-
spective. To wit, those small real bodies are hinting that the bulls
do not have full control. Also, note that the high during the week
of January 18 was also near a resistance area. As such, the small
real bodies, via the candles, were confirming that resistance
area.!

As we've seen, the Japanese place great emphasis on the rela-
tionship between the open and close because they are the two
most emotionally charged points of the trading day. The
Japanese have a proverb: "The first hour of the morning is the
rudder of the day." Likewise, the opening is the rudder for the
trading session. It furnishes the first clue about that day's direc-
tion. It is a time when all the news and rumors from overnight
are filtered and then joined into one point in time.

The more anxious the trader, the earlier he or she wants to
trade. Therefore, on the open, shorts may be scrambling for
cover, potential longs may want to emphatically buy, hedgers
may need to take a new or get out of an old position, and so
forth.

After the flurry of activity on the open, potential buyers and
sellers now have a benchmark. There are frequent analogies to

ning

trading the market and fighting a battle. In this sense, the open
provides an early view of the battlefield and a provisional indi-
cation of friendly and opposing troops.

The other pivotal price point is the close. We can thus expect
heavy emotional involvement into how the market closes. The
close is also a critical price point for many technicians. They
may wait for a close to confirm a breakout from a significant
chart point. Margin calls in the futures markets are also based
on the close. Many computer trading systems (for example,
moving average systems) are calculated from closes.

Typical of the military analogies used by candle chart analy-
sis is the way the Japanese refer to unusually big orders on the
open or close. If a large buy or sell order is pushed into the
market at or near the close, with the intention of affecting the
close, the Japanese call this action a "night attack." If this is

| done on the open, it is called, not surprisingly, a "morning
attack."

CANDLE TERMINOLOGY AND MARKET EMOTION
Technical analysis is the only way to measure the emotional component
of the market. We know that many times an ounce of emotion can be
worth a pound of facts. How else to explain a sudden shift in the mar-
ket without a change in the fundamentals?

A fascinating attribute to candle charts is that the names of the can-
dle patterns are a colorful mechanism describing the emotional health
of the market at the time these patterns are formed. After hearing the

| expression "dark-cloud cover," would you think the market is in an
emotionally healthy state? Of course not! As we will see later, this is a
bearish pattern and the name clearly conveys the unhealthy state of the
more
There are many patterns and ideas in this book, and the descriptive
names employed by the Japanese not only make candle charting fun,
but easier to remember if the patterns are bullish or bearish. For exam-
| ple, in Chapter 5 you will learn about the "evening star" and the
_ "morning star." Without knowing what these patterns look like or what
_ they imply for the market, just by hearing their names, which do you
| think is bullish and which is bearish? The evening star (the nickname for
| the planet Venus), which comes out before darkness sets in, sounds like
_ the bearish signal---and so it is! The morning star, then, is bullish since
_ the morning star (the planet Mercury) appears just before sunrise.

Darkness lies one inch ahead.
Tomcens watch for price clues alerting them to a shift in

market psychology and trend. Reversal patterns are these
technical clues. Western reversal indicators include double tops
and bottoms, reversal days, head and shoulders, and island
tops and bottoms. Yet the term "reversal pattern" is somewhat
of a misnomer. Hearing that term may lead you to think of an
old trend ending abruptly and then reversing to a new trend.
This rarely happens. Trend changes usually occur slowly, in
stages, as the underlying psychology shifts gears. A trend
reversal signal implies that the prior trend is likely to change,
but not necessarily reversing. Compare a trend to a car travel-
ing forward. The car's red brake lights go on and the car stops.
The brake light was the reversal indicator showing that the

EXHIBIT 4.1. Top Exhibits 4.1 through 4.3 are some examples of what can hap-

EXHIBIT 4.2. Top It is prudent to think of reversal patterns as trend change pat-

valuable skill. Successful trading entails having both the trend
and probability on your side. The reversal indicators are the

style to reflect the new market environment. There are many
EXHIBIT 4.3. Top . ay: . ar
Reversal ways to trade in and out of positions with reversal indicators.
We shall see many examples of this throughout the book.

An important principle is to initiate a new position (based on
a reversal signal) only if that signal is in the direction of the
major trend. Let us say, for example, that in a bull market, a top
reversal pattern appears. This bearish signal would not warrant
a short sale. This is because the major trend is still up. It would,
however, signal a liquidation of longs. We could then look for a
bullish signal on the correction to buy since the prevailing
trend was higher.

I have gone into detail about the subject of reversal patterns
because most of the candle indicators are reversals. Now, let us
turn our attention to the first group of these candle reversal
indicators, the hammer and hanging man lines.
UMBRELLA LINES
Exhibit 4.4 shows candles with long lower shadows and small
real bodies (black or white) near the top of the daily range. The

lines in Exhibit 4.4 are called umbrella lines because they look
like umbrellas. Umbrella lines are candles with very long lower
shadows and a small real body at the top end of the range. | |
These umbrella lines are fascinating in that these lines can be
either bullish or bearish according to the market environment. orBearish net Bullish
If an umbrella line emerges during a downtrend, it is a signal Exhibit 4.4. Umbrella
that the downtrend should end. In such a scenario, this umbrel- Lines
la line is labeled a hammer, as in "the market is hammering out"
a base (see Exhibit 4.5). The actual Japanese word for the ham-
mer is takuri. This word means "trying to gauge the depth of | |
the water by feeling for its bottom." This is a perfect analogy for | |
the hammer line as the market attempts to grope for a bottom. | iN
Coincidently, the hammer line looks likes a hammer with its White or
head and handle. sack
As mentioned above, the character of umbrella lines changes Exhibit 4.5. Hammer
based on the prevailing trend before the umbrella line. We saw
that an umbrella line after a decline is a bullish signal called a
hammer. However, if either of the lines in Exhibit 4.4 emerges
after a rally, it is a potential top reversal signal ominously called i or Black
a hanging man (see Exhibit 4.6). The name "hanging man" is | | | | |
derived from the fact that it looks like a hanging man with dan- |
gling legs. |
It may seem unusual that the same candle line can be both Exhibit 4.6. Hanging Man
bullish and bearish. Yet, for those familiar with Western island
tops and bottoms, you will recognize that the identical idea ;
applies here. The island formation is either bullish or bearish
depending on where it is in a trend. An island after a prolonged
rising trend is bearish, while the same island pattern after a
falling trend is bullish.
To give a sense of the challenge of unraveling candle charting
techniques, one of the books I used for my research described
the umbrella lines in Exhibit 4.4 by saying, "buy from below
and sell from above." What did that mean? Remember that I
did know about hammers and hanging man lines at the time I
read this. It took some time and some research to figure out that
the author meant that it's bullish after a falling market ("buy
from below") and potentially bearish after a rising market ("sell
from above"). The years of research required into unlocking
these "secrets of the Orient" were due to the fact that most of
