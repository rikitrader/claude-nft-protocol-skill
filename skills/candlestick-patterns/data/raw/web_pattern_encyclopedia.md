## 1. Single Candle Patterns

### 1.1 Doji (Doji / Jujisen)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal / Indecision |
| Signal | Neutral (context-dependent) |
| Candles | 1 |
| Reliability | Medium |

**Formation:** The opening and closing prices are virtually identical, producing a very small or nonexistent real body. The shadows (wicks) can vary in length.

**Psychology:** The Doji represents a standoff between buyers and sellers. Neither side managed to gain control during the session. After a prolonged trend, this equilibrium signals that the dominant force may be losing momentum.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Wait for confirmation candle in the direction of the anticipated reversal. After a downtrend, enter long if the next candle closes above the Doji high. After an uptrend, enter short if the next candle closes below the Doji low.
- **Stop Loss:** Place below the Doji low (bullish reversal) or above the Doji high (bearish reversal).
- **Target:** Nearest support/resistance level or 1:2 risk-to-reward ratio.

**Confirmation Signals:** Volume spike on confirmation candle, proximity to support/resistance level, RSI divergence.

---

### 1.2 Dragonfly Doji (Tonbo Doji)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bullish (at bottom of downtrend) |
| Candles | 1 |
| Reliability | Medium |

**Formation:** Open, close, and high are at or very near the same level, with a long lower shadow. Resembles a "T" shape. The lower shadow should be at least twice the body height.

**Psychology:** Sellers drove prices sharply lower during the session, but buyers regained full control and pushed the price back to the opening level. At the bottom of a downtrend, this signals strong buying pressure and potential trend reversal.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter long when the next candle closes above the Dragonfly Doji high.
- **Stop Loss:** Below the long lower shadow.
- **Target:** Previous resistance level or measured move equal to the shadow length.

**Confirmation Signals:** High volume during the session, occurrence at a known support level, oversold RSI.

---

### 1.3 Gravestone Doji (Tohba Doji)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bearish (at top of uptrend) |
| Candles | 1 |
| Reliability | Medium |

**Formation:** Open, close, and low are at or near the same level, with a long upper shadow. Resembles an inverted "T". The upper shadow should be at least twice the body height.

**Psychology:** Buyers pushed prices significantly higher during the session but were completely overwhelmed by sellers who drove the price back down to the open. At the top of an uptrend, this signals strong selling pressure and potential trend reversal.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short when the next candle closes below the Gravestone Doji low.
- **Stop Loss:** Above the long upper shadow.
- **Target:** Previous support level or measured move equal to the shadow length.

**Confirmation Signals:** High volume, occurrence at resistance, overbought RSI.

---

### 1.4 Long-Legged Doji (Juji Doji)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Indecision |
| Signal | Neutral |
| Candles | 1 |
| Reliability | Low-Medium |

**Formation:** Very small real body with exceptionally long upper and lower shadows of roughly equal length. The shadows must be significantly longer than the average candle range.

**Psychology:** Extreme indecision and volatility. Both buyers and sellers exerted massive pressure during the session, but neither could maintain dominance. This tug-of-war often precedes a significant move.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Wait for the next candle to establish direction; trade the breakout above the high or below the low.
- **Stop Loss:** On the opposite side of the Doji from the entry.
- **Target:** Based on the measured move of the shadow length.

**Confirmation Signals:** Elevated volume, proximity to key price levels, trend exhaustion indicators.

---

### 1.5 Hammer (Takuri / Tonkachi)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bullish |
| Candles | 1 |
| Reliability | Medium-High (60% success rate) |

**Formation:** Small real body at the upper end of the trading range. Long lower shadow at least twice the body length. Little or no upper shadow. Can be green (bullish) or red (bearish); both are bullish signals at the bottom of a downtrend.

**Psychology:** Sellers drove the price sharply lower during the session, but buyers stepped in aggressively and pushed the price back up near the open. The long lower shadow demonstrates that sellers were unable to maintain control, signaling a potential bottom.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter long on confirmation (next candle closes above the Hammer high). More aggressive: enter at the close of the Hammer candle.
- **Stop Loss:** Below the Hammer low (the tip of the lower shadow).
- **Target:** Previous swing high or 1:2 RR ratio. Use the shadow length as a measured move target.

**Confirmation Signals:** Volume above average on the Hammer candle, occurrence at support level, bullish divergence on RSI/MACD. A green Hammer is slightly more bullish than a red one.

---

### 1.6 Hanging Man (Kubitsuri)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bearish |
| Candles | 1 |
| Reliability | Medium (59% success rate) |

**Formation:** Identical in shape to the Hammer but occurs at the top of an uptrend. Small real body near the top of the range, long lower shadow (at least 2x the body), little or no upper shadow.

**Psychology:** Despite the prevailing uptrend, sellers managed to drive the price significantly lower during the session. Although buyers recovered most of the losses, the emergence of strong selling pressure is an early warning that the uptrend may be losing strength.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short on confirmation (next candle closes below the Hanging Man low).
- **Stop Loss:** Above the Hanging Man high.
- **Target:** Previous support level or measured move based on the shadow length.

**Confirmation Signals:** Gap up on the Hanging Man day (strengthens the signal), confirmation by a bearish candle, declining volume on the uptrend leading to it, proximity to resistance.

---

### 1.7 Inverted Hammer (Tohba)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bullish |
| Candles | 1 |
| Reliability | Medium-High (67% success rate) |

**Formation:** Small real body at the lower end of the trading range. Long upper shadow at least twice the body length. Little or no lower shadow. Appears after a downtrend.

**Psychology:** During a downtrend, buyers attempted to push prices higher, creating the long upper shadow. While sellers managed to push the close back near the open, the buying pressure demonstrates that bulls are beginning to challenge the bears. A confirmation candle closing above the Inverted Hammer validates the reversal.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter long when the next candle closes above the Inverted Hammer high.
- **Stop Loss:** Below the Inverted Hammer low.
- **Target:** Previous resistance or 1:2 RR ratio.

**Confirmation Signals:** Bullish follow-through candle with increased volume, support level, bullish divergence.

---

### 1.8 Shooting Star (Nagare Boshi)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bearish |
| Candles | 1 |
| Reliability | Medium (60% success rate) |

**Formation:** Small real body at the lower end of the trading range. Long upper shadow at least twice the body length. Little or no lower shadow. Appears after an uptrend. Mirror image of the Hammer.

**Psychology:** Buyers drove the price significantly higher during the session, but sellers took control and pushed the price back down to near the open. The rejection of higher prices signals that the uptrend may be exhausting, and a reversal could follow.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short when the next candle closes below the Shooting Star low.
- **Stop Loss:** Above the Shooting Star high (tip of the upper shadow).
- **Target:** Previous support or 1:2 RR ratio.

**Confirmation Signals:** High volume, occurrence at resistance, bearish divergence on oscillators.

---

### 1.9 White Marubozu (Yorikiri / Bullish Marubozu)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Continuation / Reversal |
| Signal | Bullish |
| Candles | 1 |
| Reliability | Medium-High (71% success rate) |

**Formation:** Long white (green) body with no upper or lower shadows. The open equals the low and the close equals the high. "Marubozu" means "bald head" or "shaved" in Japanese, referring to the absence of shadows.

**Psychology:** Buyers dominated the entire session from open to close with no pause or pullback. This represents maximum bullish conviction. In an uptrend, it confirms continuation. At the bottom of a downtrend, it signals a powerful reversal.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter long at the close or on a pullback to the midpoint of the Marubozu.
- **Stop Loss:** Below the Marubozu low (the open).
- **Target:** Measured move equal to the Marubozu body length projected from the close.

**Confirmation Signals:** Above-average volume, breakout above resistance, continuation on the next candle.

---

### 1.10 Black Marubozu (Bearish Marubozu)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Continuation / Reversal |
| Signal | Bearish |
| Candles | 1 |
| Reliability | Medium (56% success rate) |

**Formation:** Long black (red) body with no upper or lower shadows. The open equals the high and the close equals the low.

**Psychology:** Sellers dominated the entire session. There was no buying pressure at any point. This represents maximum bearish conviction. In a downtrend, it confirms continuation. At the top of an uptrend, it signals a powerful reversal.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short at the close or on a pullback to the midpoint of the Marubozu.
- **Stop Loss:** Above the Marubozu high (the open).
- **Target:** Measured move equal to the body length projected downward from the close.

**Confirmation Signals:** High volume, breakdown below support, bearish follow-through.

---

### 1.11 Spinning Top (Koma)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Indecision |
| Signal | Neutral |
| Candles | 1 |
| Reliability | Low |

**Formation:** Small real body (either color) with upper and lower shadows of roughly equal length that are longer than the body. Similar to a Doji but with a slightly larger body.

**Psychology:** Neither buyers nor sellers achieved a decisive advantage. The session saw significant movement in both directions but ended near where it started. This represents equilibrium and indecision in the market.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Not traded on its own. At resistance, treat as potential bearish reversal signal. At support, treat as potential bullish reversal signal. Always wait for confirmation.
- **Stop Loss:** Beyond the opposite shadow.
- **Target:** Based on the nearest support/resistance level.

**Confirmation Signals:** Context-dependent; requires additional indicators and price levels for validation.

---

### 1.12 High-Wave Candle (Koma with Extended Shadows)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Indecision |
| Signal | Neutral |
| Candles | 1 |
| Reliability | Low-Medium |

**Formation:** Very small body (can be either color) with abnormally long upper and lower shadows. The shadows are disproportionately longer than those of a typical Spinning Top.

**Psychology:** Extreme volatility and indecision. The market swung wildly in both directions but failed to establish a clear direction. This often occurs at turning points and near significant support/resistance zones.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Wait for confirmation; trade the breakout direction.
- **Stop Loss:** Beyond the extreme of the opposite shadow.
- **Target:** Key support/resistance levels.

**Confirmation Signals:** Volume analysis, proximity to key levels, subsequent directional candle.

---

### 1.13 Belt Hold -- Bullish (Yorikiri)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bullish |
| Candles | 1 |
| Reliability | Low-Medium |

**Formation:** A long white candle that opens at the low of the session (no lower shadow) and closes well above the midpoint. Appears after a downtrend. May have a small upper shadow.

**Psychology:** The market gapped down or opened at a new low, but buyers immediately took control and drove prices higher for the entire session. The absence of a lower shadow shows no seller resistance from the open.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter long on confirmation above the Belt Hold high.
- **Stop Loss:** Below the Belt Hold low.
- **Target:** Previous resistance or measured move.

**Confirmation Signals:** Gap down open, high volume, support level proximity.

---

### 1.14 Belt Hold -- Bearish (Yorikiri)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bearish |
| Candles | 1 |
| Reliability | Low-Medium |

**Formation:** A long black candle that opens at the high of the session (no upper shadow) and closes well below the midpoint. Appears after an uptrend. May have a small lower shadow.

**Psychology:** The market gapped up or opened at a new high, but sellers immediately dominated and drove prices lower for the entire session. The absence of an upper shadow shows no buyer resistance from the open.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short on confirmation below the Belt Hold low.
- **Stop Loss:** Above the Belt Hold high.
- **Target:** Previous support or measured move.

**Confirmation Signals:** Gap up open, high volume, resistance level proximity.

## 2. Double Candle Patterns

### 2.1 Bullish Engulfing (Tsutsumi)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bullish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | High (62% success rate) |

**Formation:** A small bearish (red) candle is followed by a large bullish (green) candle whose body completely engulfs the body of the previous candle. The second candle's body opens below and closes above the first candle's body. Wicks are not considered for the engulfing criteria.

**Psychology:** After a downtrend, sellers open lower but are quickly overwhelmed by buyers who drive the price above the previous session's open. The dramatic shift in power from bears to bulls signals a potential trend reversal. The larger the engulfing candle relative to the prior candle, the stronger the signal.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter long at the close of the engulfing candle or on a pullback to the midpoint.
- **Stop Loss:** Below the low of the engulfing candle.
- **Target:** Previous swing high, nearest resistance, or 1:2 RR.

**Confirmation Signals:** Volume on the engulfing candle is 2-3x the prior candle, occurrence at support, oversold conditions on RSI. The pattern is strongest when the engulfing candle is significantly larger than the prior candle.

---

### 2.2 Bearish Engulfing (Tsutsumi)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bearish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | High (82% success rate per some backtests, 57% in others) |

**Formation:** A small bullish (green) candle is followed by a large bearish (red) candle whose body completely engulfs the body of the previous candle. The second candle opens above and closes below the first candle's body.

**Psychology:** After an uptrend, buyers attempt to continue higher but are overwhelmed by sellers who drive the price below the previous open. The power shift from bulls to bears signals a potential reversal. This is one of the most reliable bearish reversal patterns.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short at the close of the engulfing candle.
- **Stop Loss:** Above the high of the engulfing candle.
- **Target:** Previous swing low, nearest support, or 1:2 RR.

**Confirmation Signals:** High volume, occurrence at resistance, overbought RSI, divergence on MACD.

---

### 2.3 Bullish Harami (Harami -- "Pregnant")

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bullish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Low-Medium (53% success rate) |

**Formation:** A large bearish candle is followed by a smaller bullish candle whose body is completely contained within the body of the first candle. The second candle's open and close are both within the range of the first candle's body (not shadows).

**Psychology:** After a downtrend, the large bearish candle continues the selling. However, the next session opens higher and while it trades within the prior candle's range, it closes higher than it opened. This containment indicates that selling pressure is diminishing and buyers are beginning to emerge.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter long on confirmation (third candle closes above the Harami high).
- **Stop Loss:** Below the low of the first (large) candle.
- **Target:** Previous resistance or 1:1.5 RR.

**Confirmation Signals:** Volume decrease on the Harami candle (shows selling exhaustion), confirmation by a bullish third candle, support level.

---

### 2.4 Bearish Harami

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bearish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Low-Medium (53% success rate) |

**Formation:** A large bullish candle is followed by a smaller bearish candle whose body is completely contained within the body of the first candle.

**Psychology:** After an uptrend, buying continues with a large bullish candle. However, the next session opens lower and trades within the prior range, closing below its open. The loss of momentum signals potential reversal.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short on confirmation (third candle closes below the Harami low).
- **Stop Loss:** Above the high of the first (large) candle.
- **Target:** Previous support or 1:1.5 RR.

**Confirmation Signals:** Volume decrease on the second candle, bearish confirmation candle, resistance level proximity.

---

### 2.5 Harami Cross (Harami Yose Sen)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bullish or Bearish (context-dependent) |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Medium |

**Formation:** A Harami pattern where the second candle is a Doji rather than a small-bodied candle. The Doji is contained within the body of the first candle.

**Psychology:** The Doji adds an extra layer of indecision to the Harami pattern. The complete loss of directional momentum (body becomes a line) within the range of the prior candle indicates that the prevailing trend has fully stalled. This is considered a stronger signal than the standard Harami.

**Trading Rules:**
- Same as standard Harami, but the signal is considered more significant.
- Always wait for confirmation on the third candle.

**Confirmation Signals:** Same as standard Harami with added weight from the Doji.

---

### 2.6 Piercing Line (Kirikomi)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bullish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Medium-High (64% success rate) |

**Formation:** First candle is a long bearish candle. Second candle opens below the first candle's low (gap down) and closes above the midpoint of the first candle's body. The deeper the penetration into the first candle's body, the stronger the signal.

**Psychology:** After a continued downtrend (first candle), the market gaps down further, suggesting more selling. However, buyers step in aggressively and push the price back up, closing well into the prior bearish candle's body. The ability to recover more than half the prior losses demonstrates significant buying power.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter long at the close of the second candle or on a break above the first candle's high.
- **Stop Loss:** Below the low of the second candle (the gap low).
- **Target:** Previous resistance or 1:2 RR.

**Confirmation Signals:** The close must penetrate at least 50% into the first candle's body (the more the stronger). High volume on the second candle, support level, bullish divergence.

---

### 2.7 Dark Cloud Cover (Kabuse)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bearish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Medium (63% success rate) |

**Formation:** First candle is a long bullish candle. Second candle opens above the first candle's high (gap up) and closes below the midpoint of the first candle's body. The bearish counterpart of the Piercing Line.

**Psychology:** After an uptrend (first candle), the market gaps up, creating initial optimism. However, sellers take control and drive prices sharply lower, closing below the midpoint of the prior bullish candle. The gap up followed by a reversal demonstrates that the high prices attracted significant selling.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short at the close of the second candle.
- **Stop Loss:** Above the high of the second candle.
- **Target:** Previous support or 1:2 RR.

**Confirmation Signals:** Second candle closes below 50% of the first candle's body, high volume, resistance level, bearish divergence.

---

### 2.8 Tweezer Bottom (Kenuki Zoko)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bullish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Medium (56% success rate) |

**Formation:** Two consecutive candles with matching or very similar lows. The first candle is typically bearish, the second is typically bullish. The lows should be within a few ticks of each other.

**Psychology:** The market tested the same support level twice and was rejected both times. The inability of sellers to push through this level indicates strong demand at that price. The bullish second candle confirms that buyers are defending the level.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter long after the second candle closes, or on a break above the high of both candles.
- **Stop Loss:** Just below the matching lows.
- **Target:** Previous resistance or measured move.

**Confirmation Signals:** Occurs at a known support level, increasing volume on the second candle, RSI oversold.

---

### 2.9 Tweezer Top (Kenuki Tenjo)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bearish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Medium (56% success rate) |

**Formation:** Two consecutive candles with matching or very similar highs. The first candle is typically bullish, the second is typically bearish. The pattern is stronger when the candles are virtually identical in shape and size.

**Psychology:** The market tested the same resistance level twice and was rejected both times. The inability of buyers to break through confirms a strong supply zone. The bearish second candle confirms seller dominance at that level.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short after the second candle closes, or on a break below the low of both candles.
- **Stop Loss:** Just above the matching highs.
- **Target:** Previous support or measured move.

**Confirmation Signals:** Occurs at known resistance, decreasing bullish volume, RSI overbought.

---

### 2.10 Bullish Counterattack Line

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bullish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Low-Medium |

**Formation:** First candle is a long bearish candle continuing a downtrend. Second candle opens sharply lower (gap down) but rallies to close at approximately the same level as the first candle's close. Both candles are long-bodied.

**Psychology:** Despite gapping down, buyers rally the price all the way back to the prior close level. The recovery from a significantly lower open demonstrates strong buying interest.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter long on confirmation above the Counterattack candle high.
- **Stop Loss:** Below the low of the second candle.
- **Target:** Previous resistance or 1:1.5 RR.

**Confirmation Signals:** Gap down opening, long bullish body on the second candle, support level, volume confirmation.

---

### 2.11 Bearish Counterattack Line

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bearish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Low-Medium |

**Formation:** First candle is a long bullish candle continuing an uptrend. Second candle opens sharply higher (gap up) but sells off to close at approximately the same level as the first candle's close.

**Psychology:** Despite gapping up, sellers drive the price all the way back to the prior close. The rejection of higher prices from a gap up demonstrates strong selling pressure.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short on confirmation below the Counterattack candle low.
- **Stop Loss:** Above the high of the second candle.
- **Target:** Previous support or 1:1.5 RR.

**Confirmation Signals:** Gap up opening, long bearish body on the second candle, resistance level, volume confirmation.

---

### 2.12 Meeting Lines -- Bullish (Deai Sen)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bullish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Low-Medium |

**Formation:** First candle is a long bearish candle. Second candle opens lower but closes at the same level as the first candle's close. Similar to the Counterattack but without requiring a gap.

**Psychology:** The matching close levels suggest that the market has found an equilibrium point where demand matches supply. The bullish second candle's ability to reach the prior close from a lower open signals emerging buying pressure.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter long on confirmation candle closing above the pattern high.
- **Stop Loss:** Below the lower of the two lows.
- **Target:** Previous resistance.

**Confirmation Signals:** Volume increase on the second candle, support proximity.

---

### 2.13 Meeting Lines -- Bearish

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bearish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Low-Medium |

**Formation:** First candle is a long bullish candle. Second candle opens higher but closes at the same level as the first candle's close.

**Psychology:** Matching close levels indicate equilibrium. The bearish candle closing at the prior close from a higher open signals seller control emerging.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short on confirmation candle closing below the pattern low.
- **Stop Loss:** Above the higher of the two highs.
- **Target:** Previous support.

**Confirmation Signals:** Volume increase on the second candle, resistance proximity.

---

### 2.14 On-Neck Pattern (Ate Kubi)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Continuation |
| Signal | Bearish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Low-Medium |

**Formation:** First candle is a long bearish candle. Second candle is a small bullish candle that opens below the first candle's low and closes at or very near the first candle's low.

**Psychology:** The small bullish bounce fails to penetrate into the prior bearish candle's body, showing that the brief rally was shallow and unconvincing. The downtrend is likely to continue.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short when price breaks below the low of the second candle.
- **Stop Loss:** Above the high of the second candle.
- **Target:** Measured move equal to the first candle's body.

**Confirmation Signals:** Bearish follow-through on the third candle, declining volume on the second candle.

---

### 2.15 In-Neck Pattern (Iri Kubi)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Continuation |
| Signal | Bearish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Low-Medium |

**Formation:** Similar to the On-Neck but the second candle closes slightly into the body of the first candle (above the close but below the midpoint). The penetration is minimal.

**Psychology:** A slightly stronger rally than the On-Neck, but the bulls still fail to push past the midpoint. The inability to sustain buying pressure confirms the downtrend's continuation.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short when price breaks below the low of the pattern.
- **Stop Loss:** Above the high of the second candle.
- **Target:** Measured move equal to the first candle's body.

**Confirmation Signals:** Bearish follow-through, low volume on the second candle.

---

### 2.16 Thrusting Pattern

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Continuation |
| Signal | Bearish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Low |

**Formation:** First candle is a long bearish candle. Second candle opens below the first candle's low and closes into the first candle's body but below the midpoint. The penetration is deeper than the In-Neck but still fails to reach the 50% mark.

**Psychology:** Buyers attempt a recovery but cannot reach the critical 50% threshold. If the close were above the midpoint, it would be a Piercing Line (bullish). The failure to reach 50% confirms bearish continuation.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short on break below the pattern low.
- **Stop Loss:** Above the high of the second candle.
- **Target:** Continuation target based on prior leg length.

**Confirmation Signals:** Low volume on the recovery attempt, bearish momentum indicators.

---

### 2.17 Matching Low (Niten Zoko)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bullish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Low-Medium |

**Formation:** Two consecutive bearish candles with identical or very similar closing prices. The lows match, forming a double bottom within a two-candle structure.

**Psychology:** The market tested the same price level on consecutive sessions and held. The matching lows create a short-term support zone, suggesting that selling pressure is exhausted at that level.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter long on a break above the high of the second candle.
- **Stop Loss:** Below the matching lows.
- **Target:** Measured move equal to the height of the pattern.

**Confirmation Signals:** Volume decrease on the second candle, support level alignment.

---

|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bearish |
| Candles | 2 |
| Reliability | Low-Medium |

**Formation:** Two consecutive bullish candles with identical or very similar closing prices. The closes match, forming a double top within a two-candle structure.

**Psychology:** The market reached the same price ceiling twice and could not push through. The matching highs create a short-term resistance zone.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short on a break below the low of the second candle.
- **Stop Loss:** Above the matching highs.
- **Target:** Measured move equal to the height of the pattern.

**Confirmation Signals:** Volume decrease on the second candle, resistance level alignment.

---

## 3. Triple Candle Patterns

1. First candle: Long bearish candle continuing a downtrend.
2. Second candle: Small-bodied candle (either color) that gaps down from the first candle. This is the "star."

**Psychology:** The downtrend continues (candle 1). Then indecision sets in (candle 2, the small star). Finally, buyers take decisive control and push prices back up well into the first candle's territory (candle 3). The transition from bearish to indecision to bullish represents a complete sentiment shift.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter long at the close of the third candle.
- **Stop Loss:** Below the low of the star (second candle).
- **Target:** Previous swing high or height of the pattern projected upward.

**Confirmation Signals:** Gap between candles 1-2 and 2-3 (ideal), volume increase on the third candle, support level, bullish momentum indicators. The deeper the third candle closes into the first candle's body, the stronger the signal.

- **Stop Loss:** Below the low of the first candle.
- **Target:** Measured move equal to the total height of the three candles, or next major resistance.

| Candles | 3 |
| Reliability | High (very rare) |

**Formation:** Three consecutive Doji candles. The middle Doji gaps away from the other two. In a bullish Tri-Star, the middle Doji gaps below; in a bearish Tri-Star, the middle Doji gaps above.

**Psychology:** Three consecutive sessions of complete indecision represent extreme uncertainty. When this occurs after a prolonged trend, it signals that the trend has completely exhausted itself. The rarity adds to the significance.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Trade in the reversal direction on the first non-Doji candle.
- **Stop Loss:** Beyond the extreme of the three Doji range.
- **Target:** Based on the prior trend length (typically targets 38.2%-50% retracement).

| Reliability | High (79% success rate) |

**Formation:**
1. First candle: Long bullish candle.
2. Candles 2-4: Three small bearish candles that trade within the range of the first candle. Each small candle may go slightly lower, but they all stay within the first candle's body/range.
3. Fifth candle: Long bullish candle that closes above the high of the first candle.

**Psychology:** After a strong advance (candle 1), profit-taking and a minor pullback occur (candles 2-4), but the pullback is shallow and contained. The final candle (5) demonstrates that the correction was merely a pause and that the uptrend resumes with conviction. The contained pullback is a sign of underlying strength.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter long at the close of the fifth candle.
- **Stop Loss:** Below the low of the three small candles.
- **Target:** Measured move equal to the first candle's length, projected from the fifth candle's close.

3. Third candle: Bearish candle that opens within the second candle's body and closes into the gap between candles 1 and 2, but does NOT completely fill the gap.

## 5. Complex / Multi-Candle Patterns

### 5.1 Three-Line Strike

| Type | Continuation (paradoxically) |
| Signal | Bullish or Bearish |
| Candles | 4 |
| Reliability | Medium-High |

**Formation (Bullish):** Three consecutive bullish candles (like Three White Soldiers) followed by a large bearish candle that engulfs all three and closes below the open of the first candle. Despite appearing bearish, this pattern is statistically a bullish continuation.

**Formation (Bearish):** Three consecutive bearish candles followed by a large bullish candle that engulfs all three.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter short on bearish confirmation below the first candle's close.
- **Stop Loss:** Above the high of the third candle.
- **Target:** Previous support.

**Confirmation Signals:** Volume increase on bearish candles, resistance level, overbought conditions.

### 5.3 Hikkake Pattern

| Reliability | Medium |

**Formation:** An inside bar is followed by a false breakout in one direction, then a reversal in the opposite direction. Essentially a failed breakout of an inside bar pattern.

- **Stop Loss:** Beyond the false breakout extreme.

- **Stop Loss:** Below the low of the fourth candle.
- **Target:** Retracement target based on the five-candle decline.

|-----------|-------|
| Type | Reversal |
| Signal | Bullish |
| Candles | 4 |
| Reliability | Medium-High (very rare) |

**Formation:**
1. Candles 1-2: Two black Marubozu candles (bearish with no shadows).
2. Third candle: Bearish candle that gaps down and has a long upper shadow that extends into the second candle's body.
3. Fourth candle: Bearish candle that completely engulfs the third candle including its shadow.

**Psychology:** The aggressive selling (two Marubozu) appears overwhelming, but the third candle's upper shadow and the fourth candle's engulfing of it show a complex fight for control that often precedes a reversal.

**Trading Rules:**
- **Entry:** Enter long on bullish confirmation above the pattern high.
- **Stop Loss:** Below the pattern low.

| Signal | Bullish or Bearish |
| Candles | 1 |
| Reliability | Medium-High |

**Formation:** A candle with a small body and a very long shadow (wick) on one side, at least 2/3 of the total candle range. The body should be at the extreme opposite end of the shadow.

- **Bullish Pin Bar:** Long lower shadow, small body at the top, appears at support.
- **Bearish Pin Bar:** Long upper shadow, small body at the bottom, appears at resistance.

**Psychology:** The long shadow represents a strong rejection of a price level. The market tried to move in one direction but was completely rejected, signaling that the opposite direction has more momentum.

- **Entry (Bearish):** Enter short on break below the Pin Bar low, or at 50% retracement of the shadow.
