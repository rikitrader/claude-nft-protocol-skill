nn methods by themselves are a valuable trading tool.
But these techniques become even more powerfully signif-
icant if they confirm one or more Western technical signals.

This is where my principle of "convergence" comes in.

I define convergence as "a cluster of technical signals con-
verging at, or near, the same price." Convergence is a pivotal
concept. This is because the more signals that join at a support
or resistance area, the more likely a reversal. The area of con-
vergence can be confirmed by a series of candle patterns or
Western signals or a combination of both.

Remember when as a kid you grabbed some crayons and
went crazy with a coloring book? Each page was a black-and-
white sketch of a beach or outer space scene. Your choice of col-
ors gave the picture your own personal touch. Likewise, based
on your trading style and personality, you likely have your
favorite tools and techniques. But whichever Western tools you
use, candles should be a part of your trading arsenal.

While I believe candle charts will replace bar charts as the
charts of choice, this does not mean I recommend ignoring the
tools used on bar charts such as trend lines, moving averages,
oscillators, etc. Indeed, I strongly suggest using classic Western
technical tools on candle charts. Here are some reasons:

1. Candle charting techniques are a tool, not a system: As such, they
should always be used in conjunction with other technical
indicators. This is a major advantage of candle charts: Since
they use the same data as a bar chart---that is, the open, high,
low, and close---you can use all your favorite Western tools
on the candle chart. This includes anything as basic as trend
lines and moving averages to the more esoteric Elliott Wave.
If a candle signal, ie., a hammer, confirms a Western signal,
say a trend line, this convergence of indicators would
increase the likelihood of a reversal. As such, candle signals
become even more powerfully significant if they confirm a
Western technical signal.

2. Price targets: Candle charts provide many useful trading sig-
nals, especially early reversal signals. They do not, however,
provide price targets. This is where measured moves---look-
ing for prior support and resistance areas, retracements,
trend lines, and other Western clues---are used.

3. Be aware of what the competition is using: Since so many traders

and analysts use technical analysis, it often has a major influ-

ence on the market. As such, it is important to be alerted to

technical signals others may be using, including Western

technical indicators.

Chapter 10 illustrates how a "cluster of candles" can dramat-
ically magnify the significance of a support or resistance area.
For the remaining chapters in Part 2, the focus will be on
Western tools, especially combined with candle charting sig-
nals. Chapter 11 addresses the many techniques one can utilize
with trend lines. For example, a failure to hold above a broken
resistance line or below broken support line can provide impor-
tant market signals. Chapter 12 looks at retracements and the
importance of waiting for confirmation of a retracement level
with a candlestick signal. Then, in Chapter 13 we look at the
value added of moving averages, especially when combined
with candlestick signals. Chapter 14 discusses oscillators
including stochastics, the relative strength index, and others,
and their usefulness when integrated with candle chart signals.
Chapter 15 focuses on what I consider one of the most impor-
tant weapons in a trader's arsenal (besides candles)---volume.
The focus in Chapter 16 is on price targets and measured
moves. This is especially important since candle charts, while
giving reversal signals, do not provide price targets. Finally,
Chapter 17 brings it all together by showing how a plethora of
Eastern and Western technical tools converged and sent many
warning signals of a reversal in the NASDAQ.

Since the focus of this book isn't Western technicals, but can-
dle charts and using candles to supplement traditional Western
technical techniques, I have only touched on the basics of
Western technical tools. There are many fine books that provide
much more detail on these Western techniques. An excellent
source of material can be found at www.TradersLibrary.com.

My quarter-century of experience with Western technicals
has been mainly the classic Western indicators. Sentiment indi-
cators such as advance/decline lines, the ARMS/TRIN index,
specialist short sales, and so on are not included. This is only
because of my limitations in knowledge, not because of limita-
tion of these tools. For example, while I don't cover point and
figure charts, traders who specialize in this charting method

have told me they use candle charts to get the reversal signals
and then shift into point and figure charts to get their price tar-
gets. This is an example of using the tools and techniques of
candles as a complementary tool, no matter your technical spe-
cialty. Western techniques, when joined with candles, can be a
powerfully efficient combination.
THE MARKET IS NEVER WRONG
To convey in my Western technical seminars the importance of a dis-
ciplined approach to trading, | use the word "DISCIPLINE" as an ana-
| gram. For each letter of the word DISCIPLINE I offer a trading rule. |
For the letter "N," my rule is "Never trade in the belief the market is
wrong."!

What do I mean by the expression "the market is never wrong"? It
means do not try to impose your beliefs on the market. For example,
if you are firmly convinced the NASDAQ is going to rally, wait until
the trend is heading north before buying. Say the NASDAQ is in a
bear market. If you buy in the expectation that a bull market will
materialize, you are then trying to impose your hopes and expecta- |
tions on the market. You are fighting the trend. This could be disas-
trous. You may ultimately be correct in your bullish viewpoint, but by
then it may be too late. As an analogy, imagine you are driving along
a one-way street. You notice a steamroller going down this one-way
street the wrong way. You stop your car, take out a sign (that you
always carry with you) that reads, "Stop! Wrong Way!" and hold it in
front of the steamroller. You know the steamroller is going in the
wrong direction. But the driver may not see you in time. By the time
the steamroller turns around, it could be too late. By then you may be
part of the pavement. > --- .

So it is with the markets. If you are bucking the trend, your outlook
may turn out to be correct---but by then it may be too late. Margin
calls in futures may force you out of the position before your expect-_

ed move occurs. Or, worse, in the end, you may be right, but by then
you could be broke. ce |

Do not try to impose your will on the markets. Be a trend follower,
not a trend predictor. If you are bullish, jump onto uptrends; if bear- |
ish, hop onto downtrends. ea |

A Japanese book | had translated expresses this idea almost poeti-
cally: "Buying or selling from the beginning without knowing the char-

acter of the market is the same nonsense as a literary man talking
about weapons. When faced with a large bull or bear market they are
sure to lose the castle; what seems safe is infinitely dangerous. ... _
Waiting for just the right moment is virtuous and essential."? ae

Notes
1. The DISCIPLINE rules are:
Don't forget old support and resistance levels. (Old support becomes
new resistance and vice versa.)
If... then system. (If the market behaves as anticipated, then stay with the
trade---otherwise exit.)
Stops---Always use them.
Consider options.
Intraday technicals are important even if you are not a day or swing trad-
er.
Pace trades to market environment. (Change your trading style according
to market conditions.)
Locals---Never forget them.
Indicators---The more the better (convergence of signals).
Never trade in the belief the market is wrong.
Examine the market's reaction to news.

Add caution to caution.
TS chapter explores how a group, or a cluster, of candle
lines and/or patterns that converge at the same price area
can magnify the importance of that area as support or resis-
tance and increase the likelihood of a market turn.
Exhibit 10.1 illustrates how a group of separate candle sig-
nals converged near $75 and, in doing so, underscored the
solidity of the support at that area. Let's look at each signal
individually:
1. The extremely long white candle on April 17 that wrapped
around the prior black real body formed a bullish engulfing
pattern. Since the white candle in this bullish engulfing pat-

tern was so large, it meant that by the time the engulfing pat-
tern was completed, the stock was nearly $25 off its lows. As
such, while the bullish engulfing pattern gave us a reversal
signal, the close of that pattern may not have presented an
attractive area to buy based on the risk/reward aspect of
such a trade.

2. Remembering the concept that the low of the bullish engulf-
ing pattern can become support, we turn our attention to the
lows of this pattern near $73 as potential support. The
downdraft that started during the week of April 17 stabilized
near this expected support area with this long-legged doji.

3. The May 22 hammer reinforced the aforementioned support
area.

4, The two sessions after the hammer at 3 completed a classic
piercing pattern with the low of that pattern bouncing off the
support area defined by the bullish engulfing pattern at 1.

5. If further proof of a bottom was needed, it came at 5 with the
small rising window in late May. Additionally, if one looks at

the action from the week of May 15 through the week of May
29, the stock was building a rounding bottom. By adding the
window (at 5) to this rounding bottom, we have a frypan
bottom.
Exhibit 10.2 displays how a confluence of candles can help
pinpoint support or resistance.
¢ A cluster of candles as support: There was a hammer on
December 11. In spite of this hammer's potentially bullish
implications, the falling window that opened on the day of
the hammer kept the trend down. As the market descended
from this hammer, it did so with a series of three long lower
shadows. These long lower shadows offset some of the bear-
ishness. The candle line at 1 was also a hammer, but unlike
the first hammer, discussed above, during the next two days,
December 16 and 17, this hammer successfully held as sup-
port. The two candles at 2 made a bullish engulfing pattern.

Another hammer emerged at 3 in early February. This was
the support area defined by 1 and 2. The dragonfly doji at 4
was further confirmation of support near $42.

e A cluster of candles as resistance: As the stock was ascending
during A, it did so via a series of long upper shadows.
Because of the higher highs, higher lows, and higher closes,
the short-term trend remained up, but the long upper shad-
ows were a warning signal that the bulls did not have a com-
plete foothold on the stock. The last long upper shadow can-
dle on January 6 was a shooting star. A few days later, at B,
the stock formed a bearish engulfing pattern. At C the small
black real body in the tall white real body formed a harami
pattern. As such, the shooting star at A, the bearish engulfing
pattern at B, and the harami at C gave us a convergence of
candles that underscored the ceiling between $47.50 and $48.

clues about the market's health, or lack thereof. Simply by look-
ing at the shape of the individual candle lines we can rapidly
see the demand/supply situation. With this in mind, let's look
at Exhibit 10.3.

In mid to late March a series of shooting stars defined resis-
tance toward $34.50. Looking at this group of shooting stars,
would there be any doubt about the trouble this stock is having
near $34.50? Of course not, since the shooting stars are graphi-
cally highlighting that each time the stock gets near its session
highs, the bears drag down prices to close the stock at or near
the lows of the day. In late August, there is another assault at
these shooting stars' resistance. Once again, there appears
another shooting star overhead on this August rally. Adding to
this shooting star's negative indication is the next day's black
real body, which completes a bearish engulfing pattern.
