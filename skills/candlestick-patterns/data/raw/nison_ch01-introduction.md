The beginning is most important.
apanese candlestick chart analysis, so called because the
J lines resemble candlesticks, has been refined by generations
of use in the Far East. Until the publication of Japanese Candle
Charting Techniques, the "claws" of Japanese charting analysis---
that is, candle charts---were a hidden secret from the Western
world for over a century. That book revealed in detail, for the
first time to the Western hemisphere, these "secrets of the
Orient."
Since the term "candlesticks" is often shortened to "candles,"
I will use both terms interchangeably throughout this book.
I am flattered that my work has been credited with revolu-
tionizing technical analysis and that all subsequent books, arti-
cles, etc. by other authors have used the first edition of this
book as their underpinning. This is what I had hoped. The

premise of that book was to lay the foundation for future can-
dle charting material. It is thus very gratifying to have this book
often called the "bible of candle charting."

Before the publication of this book in 1991 B.C. (Before
Candlesticks), who ever heard of a candlestick chart? Now, who
hasn't?

Online traders, day traders, institutional propriety traders,
and market makers are just some of the candle charting enthu-
siasts. Web sites, real-time trading systems, and technical anal-
ysis software packages include candle charts. This attests to the
popularity and universal appeal candles have to trading
today's volatile markets. Candles are hotter than ever.

| My 11-year-old son Evan (who was almost called
Candlesticks Nison when he was born) saw an online charting
service that had candle charts. He said, "Daddy, so if it wasn't
for you, there would be no candle charts on the Web or any-
where in America. Is that right?" I said that was true. He hesi-
tated and then said, "Cool, I want a raise in my allowance."
WHAT'S NEW IN THIS BOOK
While the format and underlying concepts are the same as the
first edition (if it ain't broke don't fix it), the trading environ-
ment and players in the market have changed since that edition.
Consequently, besides having all new charts, this edition has:
¢ more intraday markets
* more focus on active trading for swing, online, and day

traders

* new tactics for getting maximum use from intraday charts
¢ new Western techniques in combination with candles
* a greater focus on capital preservation
WHY HAVE CANDLE CHARTING
TECHNIQUES CAPTURED THE ATTENTION
OF TRADERS AND INVESTORS AROUND THE
WORLD?
Year after year the flames of interest grow ever brighter for
these charting tools. This is because candle charts:

e Are easy to understand: Anyone, from the first-time chartist to
the seasoned professional, can easily harness the power of
candle charts. Don't let the simplicity of these tools fool you.
Their power to analyze the health of the market is
unmatched by any other charting methodology.

° Provide earlier indications of market turns: Candle charts often
send out reversal signals well before those of traditional indi-
cators on bar or point and figure charts. This should help you
to enter and exit the market with better timing.

¢ Furnish unique market insights: Candle charts not only show
the trend of the move, as does a bar chart, but, unlike bar
charts, candle charts also show the force underpinning the
move.

e Are enjoyable to learn: The picturesque terms such as dark-
cloud covers, hammers, and windows make candle charts fun to
use. But don't let the "picturesque" names fool you. These
techniques will be potent weapons in your battle with the
markets.

| e Enhance Western charting analysis: Candle charts are so versa-
tile, they can be fused with any Western technical tool. For
our clients, we merge the insights given by the candle charts
with the most potent Western technical analysis tools. If you
are a seasoned technician, you will discover how joining

Japanese candles with your favorite technical tools can create

a powerful synergy of techniques. This merging of Eastern

and Western analysis will give you a jump on those who use

only traditional Western charting techniques.

e Will increase efficiency of your analysis: Because of the immedi-
ate visual information sent out by the candle charts, they will
make your market analysis faster and more efficient.

As the Oriental proverb states, "The journey of a thousand
miles begins with the first step." This chapter is that first step,
albeit an important one, on the road to candle chart analysis.
Yet, even after this introductory chapter, you will discover how
the candles will help make your market analysis more efficient,
improve entry and exit timing, and open new, effective, and
unique avenues of analysis.

I made a bold forecast in the first edition of this book. I said,
"In the near future, candle charts may become as standard as

---

the bar chart. As more technical analysts become comfortable
with candle charts, they will no longer use bar charts." This,
indeed, is what is unfolding.

At the conclusion of my institutional and public seminars, I
often ask the audience, "How many of you will now use bar
charts?" Of the thousands of traders who have taken my semi-
nars, no one has ever raised a hand. If you are new to candles,
you will understand why after reading this book (or even the
first few chapters).

Using candle charts instead of bar charts is a win---win situ-
ation. As we will see in the chapter on drawing candle lines,
the same data is required to draw the candle charts as for the
bar charts (open, high, low, and close). This is very significant.
It means that any of the technical analyses used with bar
charts (such as moving averages, trendlines, retracements,
etc.) can be employed with candle charts. But, and this is the
key point, candle charts can send signals not available with
bar charts. This aspect will give you a jump on those who use
only traditional Western charting techniques. By employing

| candle charts instead of bar charts, you have the ability to use

all the same analyses as you could use with bar charts. But

candle charts send out insights into the health of the market

that are unavailable anywhere else.

WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR?

This book is for you if:

e Your charting service has candle charts and you want to
unlock their full potential.

e You want to get a jump on the competition.

¢ You would like to enter and exit the market with better timing.

¢ You want added value techniques to complement trading
tools you now use.

¢ You want to have fun while you learn.

e You are new to candle charts or are a seasoned pro.

SOME BACKGROUND

"Why," I have often asked myself, "has a system that has been

around so long been almost completely unknown in the West?"

Were the Japanese trying to keep it secret? I don't know the

answer to this, but it took years of research to fit all the pieces

together. I was fortunate in several ways. Perhaps my perse-

verance and serendipity were the unique combination needed

that others did not have.

I became acquainted with a Japanese broker in 1987. One day,
while I was with her in her office, she was looking at one of her
Japanese stock chart books (Japanese chart books are in candle
form). She exclaimed, "Look, a window." I asked what she was
talking about. She told me a window was the same as a gap in
Western technicals. She went on to explain that while Western
technicians use the expression "filling in the gap," the Japanese
would say "closing the window." She then used other expres-
sions like "doji" and "dark-cloud cover." I was hooked. I spent

| the next three years exploring, researching, and analyzing any-
thing I could about candle charts.

It was not easy. My initial education was with the help of a
Japanese broker and through drawing and analyzing candle
charts on my own. Then, thanks to the Market Technicians
Association (MTA)! library in New York City, I came across a
booklet published by the Nippon Technical Analysts
Association called Analysis of Stock Price in Japan. It was a
Japanese booklet that had been translated into English.
Unfortunately, there were just ten pages on interpreting candle
charts. Nonetheless, I finally had some English candle material.

A few months later, I borrowed a book that provided some
more basic candle charting information. Once again I had found
it at the MTA library. The MTA office manager, Shelley Lebeck,
brought a book back from Japan entitled The Japanese Chart of
Charts by Seiki Shimizu and translated by Greg Nicholson (pub-
lished by the Tokyo Futures Trading Publishing Co.) back from
Japan. It was an important find since it contained about seventy
pages on candle charts and is written in English.

As I discovered, while the book yielded a harvest of infor-
mation, it took some effort and time to get comfortable with its
concepts. They were all so new. I also had to become comfort-
able with the Japanese terminology. The writing style was
sometimes obscure. Part of this might have to do with the dif-
ficulty of translation. The book was originally written in
Japanese about twenty-five years ago for a Japanese audience.
I also found out, when I had my own material translated, that
it is dreadfully difficult to translate such a specialized subject
from Japanese to English.

Nonetheless, I had some written reference material. I carried
the book with me for months, reading and rereading, taking
copious notes, applying the candle methods to the scores of my
hand-drawn candle charts (since there wasn't any candle chart-
ing software, all my charts had to be constructed by hand). I
chewed and grinded away at the new ideas and terminology. I

| was fortunate in another way---I had the help of the author,
Seiki Shimizu, to answer my many questions. Although Mr.
Shimizu does not speak English, the translator of the book,
Greg Nicholson, graciously acted as our intermediary via fax
messages. The Japanese Chart of Charts provided a base for the
rest of my investigation into candles.

In order to expand my nascent abilities in candle charting
techniques, I sought out Japanese candle practitioners who
would have the time and inclination to speak with me about
the subject. I met a Japanese trader, Morihiko Goto, who had
been using candle charts and who was willing to share his
valuable time and insights. This was exciting enough! Then he
told me that his family had been using candle charts for gener-
ations! We spent many hours discussing the history and the
uses of candle charts. He was an invaluable storehouse of
knowledge.

My real treasure trove of information is the Japanese candle
charting literature that I had translated. For this I had the
extreme good fortune to find a translator, Richard Solberg. His
ability to track down all the candle charting books in Japan (to
my knowledge, I have the largest collection outside Japan) and
his translating skills were invaluable.

In December 1989, I authored a two-page article on candle
charts. This was the first information on the subject ever writ-

ten by a non-Japanese. In early 1990, as my thesis for the
Chartered Market Technician exam for the MTA, I wrote a
paper on candle charts. This was the first detailed article ever
authored by an Occidental about Japanese candle charts. A
pamphlet at Merrill Lynch (which had over 10,000 requests)
soon followed.

Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques was published in
1991, followed in 1994 by Beyond Candlesticks (John Wiley). As
of this writing, these books have been translated into eight lan-
guages and have gone through many printings.

My work has been highlighted in financial media around the
world including The Wall Street Journal, The Japan Economic
Journal, Barron's, Worth Magazine, Institutional Investor, and
scores of other publications. An appearance on FNN (the pre-
decessor to CNBC) drew the largest audience that station ever
had.

| I've had the privilege of revealing my trading strategies to

| thousands of traders and analysts in over seventeen countries,
including, of all places, Hanoi, Vietnam. I also had the honor of
speaking before the World Bank and the Federal Reserve.

I founded Nison Research International in 1997 to provide
institutional on-site customized seminars and analytical ser-
vices.

I formed Candlecharts.Com in 2000, which offers Web-based
seminars, videos, and other services. I invite you to visit our

WHAT IS IN THIS BOOK?

In the first part of the book, you'll learn how to draw and inter-
pret scores of candle lines and formations. This will slowly and
clearly lay a solid foundation for Part 2 where you will discov-
er the value of integrating candles with Western technical tech-
niques. My goal is not to give you market omniscience. My
hope is that the ideas in this book will show how Japanese can-
dles can "enlighten" your trading.

The best way to explain how an indicator works is through
marketplace examples. The Japanese say, "One seeing is better
than a hundred hearings." Therefore, there will be numerous
real-world examples of each technique.

8 Chapter 1 © Introduction

My focus will be mainly on the U.S. markets, but the tools
and techniques in this book are applicable to any market and
time frame. This is attested by the fact that candle charts are
used on weekly (for hedgers), daily (for swing and intermedi-
ate term traders), and intraday charts (for swing and day
traders). The tactics addressed in this book can be used for
equities, futures, options, foreign exchange---anywhere and in
any time frame in which technical analysis is applied.

I have drawn illustrations of candle patterns to assist in the
educational process. These illustrations are representative
examples only. The drawn exhibits should be viewed in the
context that they show certain guidelines and principles. The
actual patterns do not have to look exactly as they do in the
exhibits in order to provide you with a valid signal. This is
emphasized throughout the book in the many chart examples.
You will see how variations of the patterns can still provide
important clues about the state of the markets.

Thus, there is some subjectivity in deciding whether a certain
candle formation meets the guidelines for that particular for-
mation, but this subjectivity is no different from that with other
charting techniques. For instance, if a stock has support at $100,
is support considered broken if prices go under $100 intraday,
or do prices have to close under $100? Does a 50-cent penetra-
tion of $100 substantiate broken support or is a larger penetra-
tion needed? You will have to decide these answers based on
your trading temperament, your risk adversity, and your mar-
ket philosophy. Likewise, through text, illustrations, and real-
world examples I will provide the general principles and
guidelines for recognizing the candle formations. But you
should not expect the real-world examples to always match
their ideal formations.

Two glossaries are at the end of the book. The first includes
candle terms and the second, Western technical terms used in
the book. The candle glossary includes a visual glossary of all
the patterns.

SOME CAUTIONS
As with any subjective form of technical analysis, there are, at
times, variable definitions that will be defined according to the

omy

Chapter 1 ¢ Introduction 9
users' experience and background. This is true of some candle
patterns. Depending on my source of information, there were
instances in which I came across different, albeit usually minor,
definitions of what constitutes a certain pattern. For example,
one Japanese author writes that the open has to be above the
prior close in order to complete a dark-cloud cover pattern.
Other written and oral sources say that, for this pattern, the
open should be above the prior high.

In cases where there were different definitions, I chose the
rules that increased the probability that the pattern's forecast
would be correct. For example, the pattern referred to in the
prior paragraph is a reversal signal that appears at tops. Thus, I
chose the definition that the market should open above the prior
day's high. This is because it is potentially more bearish if the
market opens above the prior day's high and then fails, versus if
the market opens above the prior day's close and then failed.

Much of the Japanese material I had translated is less than
specific. Part of this might be the result of the Japanese pen-
chant for being vague. The penchant may have its origins in the
feudal ages when it was acceptable for a samurai to behead any
commoner who did not treat him as expected. The commoner
did not always know how a samurai expected him to act or to
answer. By being vague, many heads were spared. However, I
think the more important reason for the somewhat ambiguous
explanations has to do with the fact that technical analysis is
more of an art than a science.

One should not expect rigid rules. Most forms of technical
analysis are guideposts. For instance, if one of the Japanese
books says that a candle line has to be surpassed to forecast the
next bull move, I equate "surpassed" with "on a close above."
That is because, to me, a close is more important than an intra-
day move above resistance or below support. This is another
example of subjectivity: In the Japanese literature many candle
patterns are described as important at a high-price area or at a
low-price area. Obviously what constitutes a "high-price" or
"low-price" area is open to interpretation. One of the tech-
niques I suggest using to gauge "low" or "high" price is an
oscillator to see if the market is oversold or overbought. This is
an example of why it is valuable to add classic Western techni-
cal tools (such as oscillators) to those of candle charts.

10 Chapter 1 ¢ Introduction

As with all charting methods, candle chart patterns are sub-
ject to the interpretation of the user. Extended experience with
candle charting in your market will show you which of the pat-
terns, and variations of these patterns, works best in your mar-
kets. In this sense, subjectivity may not be a liability. This may
give you an advantage over those who have not devoted the
time and energy in tracking your markets as closely as you
have.

As discussed in Chapter 3, drawing the individual candle
chart lines requires a close. Therefore, you may have to wait for
the close to get a valid trading signal. This may mean a market
on close order may be needed or you may have to try and antic-
ipate what the close will be and place an order a few minutes
prior to the close. You may also prefer to wait for the next day's
opening before placing an order.

This aspect of waiting for a close is not unique to candle
charts. There are many technical systems (especially those
based on moving averages of closing prices) that require a clos-
ing price for a signal. This is why there is often a surge in activ-
ity during the final few minutes of a trading session as com-
puterized trading signals, based on closing prices, kick into
play. Some technicians consider only a close above resistance a
valid buy signal so they have to wait until the close for confir-
mation.

Candle charts provide many useful trading signals. They do
not, however, provide price targets. This is why it is so impor-
tant to use Western technical techniques on candle charts. This
will be a focus of Part 2.

With the hundreds of charts throughout this book, do not be
surprised if you see patterns that I have missed within charts.
There will also be examples of patterns that, at times, did not
work. No technical tool, including candles, is infallible.

Candles are not designed to be a complete system; they are
just one weapon, albeit a powerful one, to use in your trading
battles.

Before I delve into the topic of candle charts, I will briefly dis-
cuss the importance of technical analysis as a separate disci-
pline. For those of you who are new to this topic, the following
section is meant to emphasize why technical analysis is so
important. It is not an in-depth discussion. If you are already

familiar with the benefits of technical analysis, you can skip
this section. Do not worry if you do not read the following sec-
tion, it will not interfere with later candle chart analysis infor-
mation.
THE IMPORTANCE OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
The importance of technical analysis is multifaceted. First,
while fundamental analysis may provide a gauge of the sup-
ply/demand situations (ie., price/earnings ratios, economic
statistics) and so forth, there is no psychological component
| involved in such analysis. Yet the markets are influenced at
times, to a major extent, by emotionalism. As John Maynard
Keynes stated, "There is nothing so disastrous as a rational
investment policy in an irrational world."? Technical analysis
provides the only mechanism to measure the "irrational" (emo-
tional) component present in all markets.

Here is an entertaining story about how strongly psychology
can affect a market. It is from the book The New Gatsbys.° It
takes place at the Chicago Board of Trade.

Soybeans were sharply higher. There was a drought in the

Illinois Soybean Belt. And unless it ended soon, there would be

a severe shortage of beans. . . . Suddenly a few drops of water

slid down a window. "Look," someone shouted, "rain!" More

than 500 pairs of eyes [the traders---editor's note] shifted to the
big windows. ... Then came a steady trickle, which turned into

a steady downpour. It was raining in downtown Chicago.

Sell. Buy. Buy. Sell. The shouts cascaded from the traders' lips

with a roar that matched the thunder outside. And the price of

soybeans began to slowly move down. Then the price of soy-
beans broke like some tropic fever.

It was pouring in Chicago all right, but no one grows soybeans

in Chicago. In the heart of the Soybean Belt, some 300 miles

south of Chicago the sky was blue, sunny and very dry. But even

if it wasn't raining on the soybean fields it was in the heads of the

traders, and that is all that counts [emphasis added]. To the market

nothing matters unless the market reacts to it. The game is played
with the mind and the emotions." [Emphasis added.]

In order to drive home the point about the importance of
mass psychology, think about what happens when you
exchange a piece of paper called "money" for some item like

---

a
12 Chapter 1 ¢ Introduction
food or clothing. Why is that paper, with no intrinsic value,
exchanged for something tangible? It is because of a shared
psychology. Everyone believes it will be accepted, so it is. Once
this shared psychology evaporates, when people stop believing
in money, it becomes worthless.

Second, technicals are also an important component of disci-
plined trading. Discipline helps mitigate the nemesis of all
traders, namely, emotion. As soon as you have money in the
market, emotionalism is in the driver's seat and rationale and
objectivity are merely passengers. If you doubt this, try paper
trading. Then try trading with your own funds. You will soon
discover how deeply the counterproductive aspects of tension,
anticipation, and anxiety alter the way you trade and view the
markets---usually in proportion to the funds committed.
Technicals can put objectivity back into the driver's seat. They
provide a mechanism to set entry and exit points, to set
risk/reward ratios, or stop out levels. By using them, you fos-
ter a risk and money management approach to trading.

As touched upon in the previous discussion, the technicals
contribute to market objectivity. It is human nature to see the
market as we want to see it, not as it really is. How often does
the following occur? A trader buys. Immediately the market

falls. Does he take a loss? Usually no.

Although there is no room for hope in the market, the trader
will glean all the fundamentally bullish news he can in order to
buoy his hope that the market will turn in his direction (as one
of our advisory clients put it, "You root for your position.")
Meanwhile prices continue to descend. Perhaps the market is
trying to tell him something. The markets communicate with
us. We can monitor these messages by using the technicals. This
trader is closing his eyes and ears to the messages being sent by
the market.

If this trader stepped back and objectively viewed the price
activity, he might get a better feel of the market. What if a sup-
posedly bullish story is released and prices do not move up or
even fall? That type of price action is sending out volumes of
information about the psychology of the market and how one
should trade in it.

I believe it was the famous trader Jesse Livermore who
expressed the idea that one can see the whole better when one

---

sees it from a distance. Technicals make us step back and get a
different and, perhaps, better perspective on the market.

Third, following the technicals is important even if you do
not fully believe in their use. This is because, at times, the chart
actions are the major reason for a market move. Since they are
a market-moving factor, they should be watched.

Fourth, random walk proffers that the market price for one
day has no bearing on the price the following day. But this aca-
demic view leaves out an important component---people.
People remember prices from one day to the next and act
accordingly. To wit, people's reactions indeed affect price, but
price also affects people's reactions. Thus, price, itself, is an
important component in market analysis. Those who disparage
technical analysis forget this last point.

Fifth, the price action is the most direct and easily accessible
method of seeing overall supply/demand relationships. There
may be fundamental news not known to the general public, but
you can expect it is already in the price. Those who have
advance knowledge of some market-moving event will most

| likely buy or sell until current prices reflect their information.
