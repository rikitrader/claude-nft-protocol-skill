A prudent man has more than one string to his bow.
T:' chapter examines candle techniques in conjunction
with trend lines, breakouts from trend lines, false break-

outs, and uses of penetrated support and resistance areas.

Exhibit 11.1 shows a classic rising support line. It is obtained
by connecting two, and preferably three, or more reaction lows.
When drawing rising support lines on candle charts, I use the
bottom of the lower shadows as my connecting points. This
ascending line demonstrates that buyers are more aggressive
than sellers since demand is stepping in at higher lows. There
is a saying that there are more buyers than sellers. Since a trade EXHIBIT 11.1. Rising
requires both a buyer and seller, I prefer to think of it as not Support Line

more buyers than sellers, but more aggressive buyers than sell-
ers.

Exhibit 11.2 shows a falling support line. The traditional sup-
port line, as discussed in Exhibit 11.1, is derived by connecting
higher lows. The line in Exhibit 11.2 joins lower lows. The

EXHIBIT 11.2. Falling falling line's usefulness comes into play because there will be

Support Line many instances in which prices rebound from this descending
line.This line gives us a potential support area when none may
exist. A situation where there may be no evident support is
when a market makes either a low for the move or an all-time
low.

A regular rising support line, since it is ascending, is consid-
ered bullish. The falling support line, because the market is
making lower lows, can be considered as a bearish support line.
As such, bounces from this line are likely to be only marginal
and temporary. Yet, it can be an area to consider buying, espe-
cially if there is a convergence of technical indicators at that
line.

A piercing pattern appears early on the morning of
November 22 in Exhibit 11.3. After a minor rally from this
piercing pattern, the market retreated to the $62.50 area at
around 12:30-13:00. By connecting the lows of the piercing pat-
tern to the lows near $62.50 made a few hours later, we obtain
a rising support line. This line intersected late in the session of
November 22 where we see a variation of the piercing pattern.
(It's a variation because the close of the white candle did not get
above the middle of the prior black candle.) This is an example
of how a less-than-ideal pattern can still provide a turning sig-
nal. Specifically, while this was not an ideal piercing pattern, it
helped increase its importance because it came at a rising sup-
port line. Further reinforcement that the bulls had taken control
came immediately after the successful test of this rising support
line via a rising window that became support early on
November 24.

Throughout January in Exhibit 11.4, Amazon was in down-
trend as gauged by the lower lows. Joining the lows at L1 and
L2 provides a tentative support line. Solidifying the importance
of this descending support line was another successful defense
at L3. The lows at L4 were a successful test of this downward
sloping support line and a bullish piercing pattern. The rally

EXHIBIT 11.5. Cotton---Weekly (Falling Support Line)
from this piercing pattern opened a rising window on February
2 and 3. While the bottom of this window held as support, the
rally was short-circuited with the doji (which was also a shoot-
ing star) after the long white candle on February 9.

A descending falling support line in Exhibit 11.5 commenced
with the two lows at A and B and then the bullish engulfing
pattern at C. The last test of this line came in March at D fol-
lowed by an inverted hammer. The day after this inverted ham-
mer, a white candle formed a bullish engulfing pattern. Indeed,
if the white candle of the bullish engulfing pattern had a high-
er close, it would have formed a morning star. Nonetheless, the
convergence of the inverted hammer, the bullish engulfing pat-
tern, and the falling support line shouted "Cover shorts!"

Exhibit 11.6 displays a typical falling resistance line. It is
derived by joining at least two reaction highs; three or more

EXHIBIT 11.6. Falling would give the line more clout. It shows that sellers are more

to sell at lower highs. This reflects a market that is trending
lower. With a resistance line on the candle charts, we connect
the tops of the upper shadows.
A regular resistance line is made with a series of lower highs.
But what if the market is at an all-time high and there are no
former highs from where we can peg a potential resistance EXHIBIT 117. Rising
area? In this instance I frequently use a rising resistance line. As Resistance Line
shown in Exhibit 11.7, this is built by linking a series of higher
highs (instead of the falling resistance line's lower highs).
In Exhibit 11.8 we join areas 1, 2, and 3 to obtain a classic
resistance line. At the bottom of the decline that started from
the harami at area 2, silver produced two high-wave candle
lines. This was the first indication that the downward power of
the market was dissipating. The rising window that opened
between March 6 and 7 then turned the trend up. The window
immediately became support as evidenced by the following
few days' action.
Now that there were turning signals with the candle charts,
we can shift to the Western technicals a la the resistance line to
get a price target. This becomes the potential resistance area as

shown by the market stalling there the week of March 13. This
chart underscores why one needs Western technical tools, even
if the main focus is on candles. The candles can give the earli-
est turning signals, while the Western tools can give a price
objective and stop-out area.

A new high close via a tall white candle in Exhibit 11.9 on
April 12 (at 2) keeps the bull trend in force. The next day the
whole tone of the market had been transformed as a small black
real body which completed the second part of the harami pat-
tern at 2. By connecting the highs at 1 and 2 we get a rising
resistance line that intersected near $50 in mid May. Another
harami pattern intersected with the rising resistance line at this
point of intersection at $50 at area 3. (The fact that the May 13
session's upper shadow exceeded the prior day's range doesn't
preclude this from being a harami since that pattern is only
concerned with the real bodies.) Thus, the candles give us
added proof (via the harami and long upper shadow of the sec-
ond line of the harami at 3) that the rising resistance line could
be an area where defensive actions are warranted.

EXHIBIT 11.10. Crude Oil---Daily (Rising Resistance Line)

Looking at Exhibit 11.10 we see an upward sloping resistance
line. The price activity from mid May reflects a market that is
creating a series of higher highs. However, a convergence of
technical factors on June 30, including a doji-like line (which
also formed a harami cross) at the ascending resistance line,
gave a signal for longs to take protective measures. Note the
large falling window opened the day after the doji-like line
between $31 and $30. The market fell until it found support in
early July. The rally from this support area stalled at the top of
the aforementioned window.
SPRINGS AND UPTHRUSTS Price

Objective
f

The concept of springs and upthrusts is based on work by
Richard Wyckoff, a very successful trader and newsletter pub-
lisher of the early twentieth century. ' sneuetained

Exhibit 11.11 shows that a spring develops when the market Sena'
breaks under a horizontal support area and then springs back
above that previously broken support. In other words, new EXHIBIT 11.11. Spring

Unsustained lows could not hold. Once a spring is formed, we can get a
_Aupthnus. stop-out area and a price target. As shown in Exhibit 11.11,
AW when a market gets back above a recently broken support area,
one can consider buying. If the market is solid, it should not get
Cisective back to the most recent lows. That would be a stop level
(preferably on a close). The target for the spring is either its
EXHIBIT 11.12. Upthrust high before the spring was made or the top end of its trading
range. This will be illustrated in some examples later in this sec-

tion.

Exhibit 11.12 shows an upthrust. This is when there is pene-
tration of a horizontal resistance area and then the bulls fail to
sustain these new highs. This is another way of saying a false
breakout. To use an upthrust for trading, when the market gets
back under its former resistance area, one can consider selling.
If the market is indeed weak, it should not return to the most
recent highs. A downside target is its most recent low or the
bottom of a recent trading range.

Although we will not focus on volume in this section, it will
be more bullish for a spring if the break of support is on light
volume and the subsequent rebound above the recently broken
support is on heavier volume. Similarly, the likelihood of an
upthrust successfully working should be increased if the break
over the resistance is on low volume and the consequent return
move under the old resistance is on high volume.

Why do springs and upthrusts work so well? To answer this,
refer to Napoleon's response when asked which troops he con-
sidered best. His terse response was, "Those [that] are victori-
ous." We can view the market as a battlefield between two sets
of troops---the bulls and the bears. The territory they each claim

is especially evident when there is a lateral trading range. The
horizontal resistance line is the bears' terrain to defend. The
horizontal support line is the bulls' domain to defend. If the
bears can't defend the new lows on a break of support or the
bulls maintain the new highs on a penetration of resistance,
then they are not victorious.

In Exhibit 11.13 resistance is shown at A, B, and C, with the
doji at C confirming hesitation in the 1.7100---1.7150 area. At the
session after the doji at C, a surge of demand pushed the pound
over this resistance as it approached 1.74. However, the bulls'
victory was short-lived as the market soon pulled back under

EXHIBIT 11.13. British Pound---Weekly (Upthrust)
what was broken resistance at A, B, and C. This was an
upthrust. As such, we have a downside target to the initial area
where the rally that took us to the upthrust began. Here is
where some subjectivity comes in. In my opinion the rally
began at area 1; others may view the leg up that began the rally
was the low of the bullish engulfing pattern at 2. In a scenario
like this, I suggest using a conservative target (at 1) and a more
liberal target (at 2). Interestingly, 1 became an area of temporary
stabilization before the more liberal target was obtained.

This steeply descending price action after this upthrust
reminds me of an apt Japanese saying, "Let him climb the roof
and then take away the ladder."

At times there will be "scouting parties" (this is my term and
not a candle expression) sent by big traders, commercial
accounts, or even market makers or locals to test the resolve of
the opposing troops. For instance, there might be a move by the
bulls to try to propel prices over a resistance area. In such a bat-
tle, we have to monitor the determination of the bulls. If this
bullish scouting party can set up camp in enemy territory (that

---

is, close above resistance and maintain the new highs), then a
beachhead is made. New, fresh bullish troops should join the
scouting party. The market should move up. As long as the
beachhead is maintained (that is, the market holds above resis-
tance), the bulls will have control of the market. But once the
market pushes back under the broken resistance, the bulls have
lost control.

Let's look at this idea in the context of the upthrust in Exhibit

11.14. In late September there was a resistance zone shown by
the two horizontal lines. The extended white candle of October
16 pushed the stock over this resistance. The bulls' "scouting
party" had, at least then, gotten a foothold as Juniper made a
new high close over an evident resistance area. By the next day
the whole texture of the market had changed as the black can-
dle's close proved that the bulls didn't have enough mettle to
hold the new highs. As such, an upthrust was created. The
highs of this upthrust remained resistance for the next week
before the market collapsed after the bearish engulfing pattern
that was completed October 23.
