Chapter 16 * Measured Moves 261
from the horizontal resistance area (A) to the widest part of the
triangles (at B) added to the just-broken resistance area.

The descending triangle is a pattern wherein a horizontal sup-
port area is successfully defended, but each rally from there
meets with successively lower highs. These lower highs reflect
how the bears are keeping the bulls well in check. With a pen-
etration of support, we take the widest point of the descending
triangle and add that measurement from the prior support line.

Exhibit 16.13 displays a classic descending triangle. The hor-
izontal line at 137 shows it was a clearly defined multitested
support. This was the bottom part of the descending triangle.

| The upper part of the descending triangle was a downward
sloping resistance line.

Once the bears had the wherewithal to pull the market under
the 137 support area (at the arrow), we now use the ascending
triangle projection. The highest point of the triangle is when it
began at 138.25. The bottom end of the triangle is 137. This pro-
vides us with a target toward 135.75.

One of the attractive aspects of the descending triangle is that
we can use the prior support area as new resistance (the change
of polarity). Consequently, once the bears pulled prices under
137 (at the arrow), we then know that 137---if the market is
indeed weak---should become resistance.

Further corroboration of trouble with the move under 137
was the falling window the next session. Consequently, we
have a convergence of factors for resistance near 137: the prior
support and the falling window.

CHAPTER 17
HD> BIE Te BF
If heaven drops a fig, open your mouth.
TT chapter illustrates a classic example of how I used the
principle of convergence to forecast significant trouble in

the NASDAQ.

Exhibits 17.1 and 17.1a reveal the techniques---both Eastern
and Western---that signaled a major high in the NASDAQ. It is
rare to get so many signals emerging near one area. As we will
see, while the converging of many candle and Western signals
increased the likelihood of a top reversal, these techniques did
not project the extent of correction after the market turned down.

EXHIBITS 17.1 and 17.1a. NASDAQ Composite---Daily (Convergence)
Let's look at these signals (and the chapters where these tech-
niques were discussed) individually. This discussion refers to
Exhibit 17.1 except for point 3, which uses Exhibit 17.1a.

Chapter 17 © The Best of the East and West: The Power of Convergence 265

1. An ascending resistance line obtained by connecting the
highs from the week of February 14 to the highs in early
March (this technique is discussed in Chapter 11). Since the
NASDAQ was in uncharted territory, this rising resistance
line was a useful mechanism to obtain a potential supply
area as the market ascended.

2. A shooting star (Chapter 4) on March 10 was a candlestick
signal confirming the potential resistance at the rising resis-
tance line discussed above.

3. See Exhibit 17.1a. This is an hourly chart that shows a bear-
ish engulfing pattern (Chapter 4) on March 10 (at 3). This
bearish engulfing pattern emerged early the same day as the
shooting star of the daily chart (discussed in point 2 above).

4. Returning to Exhibit 17.1, at the time the NASDAQ made
new highs at the shooting star at 2, the oscillator (Chapter 14)
made a lower high. This was bearish divergence.

5. Avery small falling window opened between the sessions of
March 10 and 13 (Chapter 7). This falling window is more
evident in Exhibit 17.1a on the hourly chart. Once this falling
window opened, it turned the trend southward. It then
becomes potential resistance. The decline from this falling
window found some stabilization at a hammer (Chapter 4)
on March 16. This hammer became support a few days later,
from where a rally ensued.

6. The rally that began on March 21 stalled at the window's
resistance (from point 5 above) with a high-wave candle
(Chapter 8). Although the upper shadow of the candle line at
6 moved over the window's resistance, the failure to close
above this window reinforced the major resistance area
between 5050 and 5150.

Based on the above, we have the major convergence of candle
signals, including the shooting star, bearish engulfing pattern,
falling window, and high-wave candle, with the Western signals
of a rising resistance line and bearish divergence. This cluster of
signals converging in the 5050-5150 area greatly strengthened
the prognosis that the NASDAQ had reached a ceiling.

Step after step the ladder is ascended.
A spending some time with candles, I am sure that you
will not trade without the insights they offer. If a picture

is worth a thousand words, then a candle chart sends out vol-
umes.

Candle charts are so popular and powerful that they are
replacing bar charts, but that does not mean I only use candle
indicators. While candles techniques are powerful, they are
more potent when joined with other charting tools. This is the
advantage of candle charts. With them you can use candle tech-
niques, Western techniques, or a combination of both.
Experienced technicians will find that the union of Eastern and
Western techniques creates a wonderfully exciting synergy.

Be flexible about chart reading. Where you stand in relation
to the overall technical evidence may be more important than
an individual candle pattern. For example, a bullish candle sig-
nal in a major bear market should not be used as a buy signal.
A bullish candle formation, especially when confirmed by
other technical signals in a bull market, would be a buying
point.

Also consider the risk/reward aspect of a potential trade.
Just because there is a candle signal does not mean one should
trade on it.

Candles, as all other charting methods, require subjectivity.
You are a doctor of the market. How you read and react to the
symptoms of the market's health through candles techniques
may not be the same as another candle practitioner. How you
trade with candles will depend on your trading philosophy,
your risk adversity, and your temperament. There are very
individual aspects.

May the candles light your trading path!

idates via a series of small real bodies near the recent highs.
If prices gap above this consolidation area, it becomes a high-
price gapping play. 2. Low-price gapping play---After a sharp
price decline, the market consolidates via a series of small
real bodies near the recent lows. If prices gap under this con-
solidation, it is a sell signal.

Golden cross---A bullish signal in which a shorter-term moving
average crosses above a longer-term moving average. It is the
opposite of the dead cross.

Gravestone doji---A doji in which the opening and closing are at
the low of the session. It is a reversal signal at tops. See the
illustration under Doji. The opposite of this doji is the drag-
onfly doji.

Hammer Hammer---An important bottoming candlestick line. The ham-
mer and the hanging man are both the same lines that are
I generally called umbrella lines; that is, a small real body
' (white or black) at the top of the session's range and a very
long lower shadow with little or no upper shadow. When
this line appears during a downtrend, it becomes a bullish
| hammer. For a classic hammer, the lower shadow should be
at least twice the height of the real body.
Hanging Man

Hanging man---A top reversal that requires confirmation. The
hanging man and the hammer are both the same type of can-
| | dlestick line (i-e., a small real body [white or black], with lit-
tle or no upper shadow, at the top of the session's range and
a very long lower shadow). But when this line appears dur-
ing an uptrend, it becomes a bearish hanging man. It signals
the market has become vulnerable, but there should be bear-
ish confirmation the next session with an open, and better is
a close, under the hanging man's real body. In principle, the
hanging man's lower shadow should be two or three times

the height of the real body.
Harami Harami---A two-candlestick pattern in which a small real body
holds within the prior session's unusually large real body.
i . The harami implies the immediately preceding trend is con-
cluded, and the bulls and bears are now in a state of truce.
The color of the second real body can be white or black. Most
often the second real body is the opposite color of the first

real body.

line. It is also called a petrifying pattern.

High-price gapping play---See Gapping plays.

High-wave candle---A candle with very long upper and lower wah W
shadows and a small real body. It shows that the market is righ Weves
losing its direction bias that it had before this candle
appeared. If the real body is a doji instead of a small real
body, it is a long-legged doji.

In-neck line---A small white candlestick in a downtrend whose
close is slightly above the previous black candlestick's low of In Neck
the session. After this white candlestick's low is broken, the
downtrend should continue. Compare to on-neck line, thrust-
ing line, and piercing pattern.

Inverted hammer---Following a downtrend, this is a candlestick
line that has a long upper shadow and a small real body at Inverted Hammer

| the lower end of the session. There should be no, or very lit- |
tle, lower shadow. It has the same shape as the bearish shoot- | Ihy
ing star, but when this line occurs in a downtrend, it is a I
bullish bottom reversal signal with confirmation the next ses-
sion (i.e., a candlestick with a higher open and especially a
higher close compared to the inverted hammer's close).

Inverted three Buddha pattern---See Three Buddha pattern.

candle. The black candle opens within the white real body
and closes under the white candle's real body. The close on
the black candle day is the fight point. A downward (or down-
side) gapping tasuki is when the market gaps down with a
black candle followed by a white candle. The two candles of
the tasuki should be about the same size. Both types of tasu-
ki are rare.
Three Buddha patterns---A three Buddha top is the same as the
