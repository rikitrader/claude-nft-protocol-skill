EXHIBIT 14.1. Albertson's---Daily (RSI)

This convergence of bearish divergence and the dark-cloud
cover reinforced the potential bearish implications of the dark-
cloud cover. Trend lines can also be used on the relative
strength index. This is shown by the dashed line on the oscilla-
tor. Note that, once this rising support line was penetrated, it
became another negative signal.

A key concept with candle charts is that the overall technical
picture is more important than a single candle line. One should
always view the candle line or candle pattern in the context of
its market surroundings.

In Exhibit 14.2 there are two bullish engulfing patterns
shown as 1 and 2. (Although the open of the white candle of
this pattern was the same as the close of the black candle, this
is acceptable as a bullish engulfing pattern since foreign
exchange markets' open and close are the same.) Bullish
engulfing pattern 2 was more important than bullish engulfing
pattern 1 because the second bullish engulfing pattern was con-
firmed by bullish divergence. In the first bullish engulfing pat-
tern, the RSI was continuing its descent as the stock made new
lows. This kept the bearish momentum intact.

MOVING AVERAGE OSCILLATOR
Computing the Moving Average Oscillator
This indicator is obtained by subtracting the shorter-term mov-
ing average from the longer-term moving average. It has plus
or minus values. Thus, a value above 0 means the shorter-term
moving average is above the longer-term moving average. A
reading under 0 means the shorter-term moving average is less
than the longer-term moving average.
Using the Moving Average Oscillator
Since this oscillator uses a short- and long-term moving aver-
age, we are comparing the short-term momentum to a longer-
term momentum. This is because the short-term moving aver-
age is more responsive to recent price activity. If the short-term
moving average is relatively far above (or below) the longer-
term moving average, the market is said to be overbought (or
oversold). As with the other oscillators, the moving average
oscillator is also used as a divergence vehicle.

As prices increase, the technician wants to see the short-term
moving average increase relative to the longer-term moving
average. This would mean increasing positive values for the
moving average difference line. If prices advance and the dif-
ference between the short- and long-term moving averages nar-
rows, the market is indicating that the shorter-term momentum
is running out of steam.

During the first week of May in Exhibit 14.3 the Eurodollar
built a bullish engulfing pattern at B. After a small rally from
this pattern, the market retreated and found support, as expect-
ed, at the lows of the bullish engulfing pattern. Not only was
the support area defended with a May 19 hammer, but there
was also the bullish divergence as the Eurodollar marginally
made a new low while the moving average oscillator made a
higher low with the hammer. Once the market pushed above
.9200 from the hammer, it confirmed a double bottom made
with the dual lows at the bullish engulfing pattern and ham-
mer. As will be discussed in Chapter 16, we can use a breakout
from the .350 trading range (i.e., from .8850 to .9200) to give us
a target toward .9550 (obtained by adding the .350 trading

| range onto the breakout point of .9200).

In Exhibit 14.4 Catalina was ascending along a rising resis-
tance line. During the week of July 13, although the stock was
hovering near its current highs, a series of small real bodies
showed that the bulls' advance was being constrained by the
bears. This hesitation near $56 is not surprising considering
that level was resistance in late April.

We now turn our attention to the moving average oscillator.
At the time of the aforementioned small real bodies in mid July,
there was also bearish convergence. Consequently, we have a
classic example of convergence at $56. Specifically: (1) The
stock was at a resistance area based on the rising resistance line
and the prior April price peak; (2) a series of small real bodies
showing a market separating from its bull trend; and (3) the
bearish divergence. If we need more proof of a market in trou-
ble, then we would have received this signal with a falling win-
dow (at the arrow) that became resistance.

Exhibit 14.5 displays a key use of candles and oscillators.
Most equity traders are buyers; relatively few are short sellers.
A challenge longs may have is knowing when to exit a position.
This is where an oscillator, especially when confirmed with a
candles line or pattern, can become useful. As we saw in

Exhibit 14.4, when a stock becomes overextended and there is

also a candlestick confirming a turn, it could be a good place to

either exit longs or lighten up on long positions. With this in

mind, let's look at each overbought occurrence:

1. There were two hanging man lines at H in the first week of
March. These appeared during an overbought market (based
on the oscillator), but they were not confirmed by a close
under their real bodies. Remember, for bearish confirmation
of a hanging man, we need a close under the hanging man's
real body to confirm a hanging man's potentially bearish
implications. Additionally, the market formed a rising win-
dow on the first hanging man session. As such, the window
became support. So, while the market was overextended,
there was no bearish confirmation of a market rate turn at 1
based on the candle lines. The bearish engulfing pattern at B
on March 18 and 19 was a turning signal not only because of
the bearish engulfing pattern itself, but also because at the
time of that pattern the stock had made a new high and the
moving average oscillator had made a lower high. This
formed bearish or negative divergence.

2. An overbought reading with the oscillator, but no turning

| signals with the candles since the candle line during the

| overbought reading was a tall white real body. A few days
after this white real body we can see a bearish engulfing pat-
tern (at C) which became resistance for a few sessions.

3. On April 7 Wal-Mart moved above the bearish engulfing pat-
tern discussed above. As such, it could be viewed as a bullish
breakout. At area 3 the oscillator was overbought, but there
were no turning signals with the candles and we would not
look to sell. A cautionary signal would come a few days later
with a long-legged doji after a tall white candle.

4. An overbought oscillator with a doji confirming a potential
turn. While the stock hesitated at this doji, a small rising win-
dow opened between April 22 and 23 as support. Thus, we
would need further bearish confirmation by a close under
the window. The break of the window's support occurred on
April 28.

5. A hanging man at the arrow on May 11 and an overextended
oscillator gave us a turning signal. The bearish implications
of the hanging man were confirmed by a lower close the next
day.

6. A doji confirming hesitation. Similar to 4, there was a rising
window that needed to be closed before the trend could be
viewed as damaged. The close under the window's support
took place on June 8.

STOCHASTICS
The stochastic oscillator is another popular tool. It, like all the
other oscillators, provides overbought and oversold readings
and signals divergences. It also affords a mechanism to relate a
shorter-term trend to a longer-term trend. The stochastic indi-
cator compares the latest closing price with the total range of
price action for a specified period. Stochastic values are
between 0 and 100. A high stochastic reading would mean the
close is near the upper end of the entire range for the period. A
low reading means that the close is near the low end of the
period's range. The idea behind stochastics is that as the mar-
ket moves higher, closes tend to be near the highs of the range;
as the market moves lower, prices tend to cluster near the lows
of the range.

Computing Stochastics
The stochastic indicator is comprised of two lines: the %K and
the %D. The %K line, called the raw stochastic or the fast %K,
is more sensitive. The formula for the %K line is:
(Close) --- (Low of N) 6
(High of N) - (Low of Ny * 100=

where Close = current close

Low of N = low of the range during the period used

High of N = high of the range during the period used

The "100" in the equation converts the value into a percent-
age. Thus, if the close today is the same as the high for the
period under observation, the fast %K would be 100%. A period
can be in days, weeks, or even intraday (such as hourly).
Fourteen, nineteen, and twenty-one periods are some of the
more common periods.

Because the fast %K line can be so volatile, this line is usually
smoothed by taking a 3-period moving average of the last three
%K values. This 3-period moving average of %K is called the
slow %K. Most technicians use the slow %K line instead of the
choppy fast %K line. This slow %K is then smoothed again using
a 3-day moving average of the slow %K to get what is called the
%D line. This %D is essentially a moving average of a moving
average. One way to think of the difference between the %K and
%D lines is too view them as you would two moving averages
with the %K line comparable to a short-term moving average,
and the %D line comparable to a longer-term moving average.
Using Stochastics :
As mentioned previously, stochastics can be used in several
ways. The most popular method is as a tool for showing diver-
gence. Most technicians who monitor stochastics use this
aspect of divergence in conjunction with overbought/oversold
readings.

Some technicians require another rule: to have the slow %K
line cross under the %D line for a sell signal, or for the slow
%K to move above the %D for a buy signal. This is compara-
ble to the bullish (bearish) signal of a faster moving average
crossing over (under) the slower moving average.

Another use is as a gauge for overbought/oversold. Most
traders will view an 80% or higher reading as overbought, and

---

Chapter 14 © Candles with Oscillators 235
20% or lower as oversold. For instance, to get a buy signal, the
market must be oversold (20% or less for %D), there is positive
divergence, and the %K line is crossing above the %D line.

Exhibit 14.6 displays a small bearish engulfing pattern at B in
the early morning of October 23. Normally such a small bearish
engulfing pattern is not significant, but, when combined with
stochastics, we see that the stochastic is overextended and there
is a bearish crossover (where the faster %K line crosses under
the slower %D line). This put more significance on the bearish
engulfing pattern. We look for the high of this pattern at $105 to
be resistance. This resistance held as a stock got to $104 the fol-
lowing morning from where it then failed.

A large falling window opened October 25. A nicely defined
hammer appeared early the next morning (October 26). A few
periods before this hammer, we got a tentative clue of bottom
with the stochastics. Specifically, early on October 26 the
stochastic was in oversold territory (that is, below 20%). We
also see a bullish crossover where the faster %K line crossed
above the slower %D line. Soon after the stochastic turning sig-
nal, we got a bullish candle signal with the aforementioned
