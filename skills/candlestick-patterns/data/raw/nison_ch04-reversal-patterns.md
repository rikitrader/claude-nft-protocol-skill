the candle patterns and techniques were described in similarly
vague descriptions. It's a good thing I like challenges!

The hammer and hanging man can be recognized by three
criteria:

1. The real body is at the upper end of the trading range. The
color of the real body is not important.

2. It has a long lower shadow that should be at least twice the
height of the real body.

3. It should have no, or a very short, upper shadow.

There are three aspects that differentiate the hanging man
from the hammer---trend, extent of the move before the candle
line, and confirmation. Specifically:
¢ Trend: A hammer must come after a decline. A hanging man

must come after a rally.

| e Extent of the move before the candle line: A hammer is valid even
if it comes after a short-term decline, but a hanging man
should emerge after an extended rally, preferably at an all-
time high.
* Confirmation: As will be addressed later, a hanging man
should be confirmed, while a hammer need not be.

The longer the lower shadow, the shorter the upper shadow;
the smaller the real body, the more meaningful the bullish ham-
mer or bearish hanging man. We will now focus on the hammer
and then the hanging man.

Hammer

The real body of the hammer can be white or black. This is
because even if the real body of the hammer is black, we can see
in Exhibit 4.5 that it still closed near the session highs. We can
say it is slightly more bullish if the real body of the hammer is
white (because it closed at the high). The Japanese nickname for
a white hammer is a "power line." In my experience, the suc-
cess of the hammer is not dependent on the color of its real
body.

The hammer's long lower shadow and close at, or near, the
high of the session graphically relays that the market sold off

sharply during the session and then bounced back to close at,
or near, the session's high. This could have bullish ramifica-
tions. This aspect of closing at or near the highs is why the
hammer should have no, or a minuscule, upper shadow. If
there was a long upper shadow, this would mean the market
closed well off its highs, which is an important criterion for the
hammer.

Since the hammer is a bottom reversal signal, we need a
falling trend to reverse.

In Exhibit 4.7 we see a hammer on February 24. It's classic
because of its extended lower shadow and small real body at
the top end of the trading range. It also followed a decline. This

| is a necessary condition for a hammer.

The line on February 22 would not be defined as a hammer
because it didn't have the required lower shadow of two or
three times the height of the real body. Such a lower shadow is
necessary because it would display that the market had been
pushed down sharply lower during the session, but by the end
of the session, as the Japanese would say, there was a

"kamikaze fight" as the bears lost control as adduced by the
fact that the market closed at, or near, its session highs. This
was visually shown with a classic hammer on the 24th. You can
bet that after a day like this classic hammer, the bears are hav-
ing second thoughts.

Exhibit 4.7 brings out a vital aspect of candle charting.
Successful trading with candle charts requires an understand-
ing not only of the candle patterns, but also of where the can-
dle pattern appears and in the context of risk/reward analysis.
One should always consider the risk/reward aspect before
placing a trade based on a candle pattern or candle line. Let's
look at the ideal hammer on the 24th keeping this aspect of
risk/reward in mind.

By the time the hammer was completed (remember, we have
to wait for the close), the stock closed near $48. Thus, if one
bought at the completion of a hammer (around $48), the risk
would be under the hammer's lows of near $43. That is around
$5. We now have a $5 risk. There is nothing wrong with that if

| your target is much greater than $5. However, for some active
traders $5 might be too large a risk.

As such, to help lower the potential risk of the trade, one
could wait for a correction to within the hammer's lower shad-
ow (of course, there will be many times when the market will
not correct after the hammer). By using the hammer's lows as a
potential purchase area, we have bought closer to the stop out
area.

Let's imagine Trader A recognizes the hammer on February
24. He is so excited by this beautifully defined hammer that he
buys at the hammer's close near $48. The next session, the mar-
ket gaps down to $44.50 on the opening. Trader A is now
underwater by $3.50. He may decide to exit the prior day's long
position with a $4.50 loss. In such a scenario Trader A may have
said the candles did not work.

Trader B recognizes the hammer's potential turning signal,
but remembering the aspect of risk/reward does not buy on the
hammer's close (because the risk would be too much for her).
The next day, when the market opened lower, it was then near
a potential support area at the lower end of the long lower
shadow. Trader B recognizes the stock is now near potential

---

support and decides to buy. After the stock rallied from this
support area, Trader B would sing the praises of candles.
Of course, there will be times when a market fails to hold
potential support or resistance areas as well as they did with
this hammer. How you personally utilize the power of the can-
dle charts will be an important component of how successful
the candles turn out to be for you.
In the prior chart we saw how a hammer can become a
potential support. In Exhibit 4.8 we show how a hammer can
also be used to help confirm support. In this chart of the NAS-
DAQ-100 (NDX), there is a rally that started at area A. The first
sign that the ascent was slackening were the two small black
real bodies (at 1 and 2) near 3723. The market retreated steeply
from there. As it neared the potential support area near 3680
(support at A), a hammer formed. If the support is solid, the
| hammer should then become a support, as it was for the next
two sessions. Of course, if the NDX had closed under the 3680
support area, our bullish outlook would have been voided.
That is an important aspect of technicals---there should always

be a price that says we are wrong. In this case it would have
been under 3680.

In Exhibit 4.9 we see a hammer with an extended lower shad-

ow whose diminutive real body is at the top end of the session.
We should note that a hammer can have a little upper shadow,
as is the case here. This hammer became a solid floor of sup-
port.
Hanging Man
The hanging man has the same shape as the hammer; the only
difference is that a hanging man comes after an advance (see
Exhibit 4.6). Because a long lower shadow is viewed as a plus,
and since the hanging man has such a shadow, it is especially
important that one wait for bearish confirmation with the
hanging man. At a minimum this would be a lower opening
under the real body of the hanging man. But I usually recom-
mend a close beneath the hanging man.

Chapter 4 ¢ Reversal Patterns 39
The reason for waiting for a close under the hanging man's

real body is that if the market closes lower the next day, those
who bought on the open or close of the hanging man day (and
lots of trading occurs at these two times) are now left "hang-
ing" with a losing position. This is why I would also like to
see the hanging man at an all-time high, or at least at a high
for a significant move. In this scenario the longs entering on
the hanging man session are in their position at new highs,
thus making them more nervous. Consequently, those longs
might decide to back out of their now losing position. That
could cascade into more selling pressure. Note how the sec-
ond small real body in Exhibit 4.8 (line 2) was a hanging man
whose bearish implications were confirmed by a lower close
the next session.

| Exhibit 4.10 is an excellent example of how the same line can
be bearish (as in the hanging man line on January 29) or bullish
(the hammer on February 22). Although both the hanging man
and hammer in this example have white bodies, the color of the
real body is not of consequence.

The first line was a hanging man because the trend preceding
it was a rally. The hanging man was made at new highs for the
move. The next day (February 1) the market closed lower than
the hanging man's real body, leaving all those new longs---who
bought on the hanging man's open or close---in pain.

The line on February 22 was a hammer because it followed a
downtrend. The session before the hammer was a small real
body. This was an early clue that the bears' drive was being
inhibited. The hammer was more bullish proof of this.

In Exhibit 4.11, on December 13, we see an upside breakout
from a short-term box range (the Japanese term for a lateral trad-
ing range). The rally from this breakout continued with three
extended white real bodies, each of which opened near its low
and closed at or near its highs. This underscored the bulls'
domination. Some cautionary signals emerged after the third
long white candle when a series of candles with upper shadows
arose. Note also what was happening with the slope of the
highs as we got these upper shadows. The slope from one high
to the next was decreasing (shown by the curving line). That

meant although new highs were still being made, the pace of
the rally was slackening.

The real hint that the bulls were losing control of the market
was with a hanging man session. Not only was this a hanging
man session, but it was also the first black real body and the
first spinning top of the rally. Confirmation of the hanging man
came at the next session's close under the hanging man's real
body. An attempt a couple days later to push the market high-
er stalled near $32 via a series of long upper shadows.

The descent from the hanging man at $32 lost bearish
momentum near $27. We were able to tell this by what hap-
pened after long black real bodies at A and B. Specifically, on
the day after each of these long black real bodies there was a
small real body. We would think that after each bearish session
at A and B, the market would continue lower the next session.
But it didn't as shown by the spinning tops. This showed that
the bears, as shown by the two long black candles at A and B,
had tried to take control twice but on both occasions failed. This

| probably gave the bears second thoughts about selling and
more encouragement for those thinking about buying.

Exhibit 4.12 highlights the importance of waiting for bearish
confirmation with a hanging man. Candle lines at 1, 2, and 3
were hanging man lines (their upper shadows were small
enough to keep them as hanging man lines). Each of these lines
made a new high close for the move and thus kept the bullish
momentum in force. To confirm the bearishness of any of these
hanging lines, and to convert the trend from up to less positive,
we would need a close under any of these hanging man real
bodies. That did not occur. Remember, anybody who bought on
the opening and closing of the hanging man session bought at
the highs of the move. If the market continues higher after the
hanging man session (as it did here), are these longs in pain? Of
course not. They're happy because the market is higher than
where they bought. As such, as shown in this example, if the
market does not close under the hanging man's real body, then
the bull trend remains entrenched.

THE ENGULFING PATTERN
The hammer and hanging man are individual candle lines. As
| T | previously seen, single candle lines through the color, length,
| | | | and size of the real bodies and the shadows can send important
| b i signals about the market's health. Most candle signals, howev-
er, are based on combinations of individual candle lines. The
_ engulfing pattern is the first of these multiple candle line pat-
Eneulfing Pattern terns. The engulfing pattern is a major reversal signal with two
opposite color real bodies composing this pattern.
Exhibit 4.13 shows a bullish engulfing pattern. The market is
falling. Then a white bullish real body wraps around, or
( i | engulfs, the prior period's black real body (hence its name).
| | | Another nickname is a "hugging line" for obvious reasons.
| | | (Maybe on Valentine's Day I will refer to the engulfing pattern
| as a hugging pattern.) This shows buying pressure has over-
Enpulfing Pattorn whelmed selling pressure.

Chapter 4 ¢ Reversal Patterns 43

Exhibit 4.14 illustrates a bearish engulfing pattern. Here the
market is trending higher. A white real body engulfed by a
black real body is the signal for a top reversal. This shows that
supply has overwhelmed demand.

There are three criteria for an engulfing pattern:

1. The market has to be in a clearly definable uptrend (for a
bearish engulfing pattern) or downtrend (for a bullish
engulfing pattern), even if the trend is short term.

2. Two candles comprise the engulfing pattern. The second real
body must engulf the prior real body (it need not engulf the
shadows).

3. The second real body of the engulfing pattern should be the
opposite color of the first real body. (The exception to this
rule is if the first real body of the engulfing pattern is a doji.
Thus, after an extended fall, a doji engulfed by a very large
white real body could be a bottom reversal. In an uptrend, a
doji enveloped by a very large black real body could be a
bearish reversal pattern).

The closest Western analogy to the Japanese engulfing pat-
tern is the outside reversal session. In classic Western techni-
cals, this occurs when, during an uptrend (or downtrend), a
new high (or low) is made with prices closing under (or above)
the prior day's close.

Some factors increasing the likelihood that an engulfing pat-
tern could be an important turning signal are: So
1. If the first day of the engulfing pattern has a very small real

body (i.e., a spinning top) and the second day has a very long

real body. The small first real body candle reflects a dissipa-
tion of the prior trend's force and the large second real body
proves an increase in force behind the new move.

2. If the engulfing pattern appears after a protracted or very
fast move. A fast or extended move creates an overextended
market (either overbought or oversold) and makes it vulner-
able to profit taking.

3. If there is heavy volume on the second real body of the
engulfing pattern. Volume will be discussed in Part 2.

Exhibit 4.15. Resistance for Bearish Engulfing Exhibit 4.16. Support for Bullish
Patterns Engulfing Patterns

A prime use of the engulfing pattern is utilizing them as sup-
port or resistance. This is illustrated in Exhibits 4.15 and 4.16. In
Exhibit 4.15 I use the high of the two candle lines that make the
bearish engulfing pattern. That high becomes our resistance
(based on a close). As shown in Exhibit 4.16, the same concept
is used for the bullish engulfing pattern. With that I have found
that the lowest low of that pattern should become support.

This technique of the bearish engulfing pattern as resistance
and support is especially useful if the market has moved too far
from the lows (with a bullish engulfing pattern) or highs (with
a bearish engulfing pattern) to be comfortable selling or buy-
ing. For example, by the time a bullish engulfing pattern is
completed (remember, we need to wait for the close of the sec-
ond session before we know it's a bullish engulfing pattern),
the market may be well off its lows. As such, I would feel that
it has gotten away from an attractive buying area. In such a sce-
nario, we can wait for a possible correction to our support area
at the lows of the bullish engulfing pattern and then consider
stepping in from the long side. The same would be true, but in
reverse, for a bearish engulfing pattern.

In Exhibit 4.17 we see that the first white candle after six ses-
sions of black descending candles emerged early on May 5.
This white candle completed the bullish engulfing pattern. We
then use the low of the bullish engulfing pattern (the lowest
low of the two sessions that comprise the pattern) as support
near $56. Lucent rallied from this bullish engulfing pattern and
then stalled at a bearish engulfing pattern. Note how the high
of this bearish engulfing pattern became resistance the next ses-
sion. With the descent from this bearish engulfing pattern, a
doji sent a tentative clue that the stock was trying to stabilize
near the potential support at the bullish engulfing pattern. The
stock rallied from this successful test of the bullish engulfing

pattern's support, hesitated for a few sessions at the bearish
engulfing pattern's resistance, and then continued its ascent
along a rising support line. |
In Chapter 1, I addressed ‘the significance of real bodies, but
shadows should be a pivotal part of your analysis. We look at an
example of this aspect in Exhibit 4.18.1 A series of long upper
shadows---otherwise known as bearish shadows---arose during
the weeks of November 2 and 16. These long upper shadows
sent a strong visual clue that the market was rejecting the 1.1850
area. The decline that began after the second set of long upper
shadows ended with a hammer (a candle with an extended
lower shadow---another example of the shadow's significance).
A few days after the hammer, the stock pulled back via a long
black real body (that marginally broke the hammer's support).
The next day a tall white candle completed a bullish engulfing
pattern. The rally that began from the bullish engulfing pattern
terminated at the doji at 1.1950. Note how the doji confirmed a
resistance area defined by the late October's series of long upper

shadows. Remembering the concept of the bullish engulfing
pattern as potential support, we look to the November 27 and 28
bullish engulfing pattern near 1.1470 as support. A successful
test at this area occurred the week of January 11.

A major low in crude oil came with a classic bullish engulf-
ing pattern as shown in Exhibit 4.19. This was a classic pattern
insofar as the first real body was a small black real body (this
showed the bears were losing a foothold) and the second can-
dle was a vibrant long white real body that opened on its low
and closed near its high. What was so significant about this par-
ticular bullish engulfing pattern was that the white real body
engulfed not only one black real body, but three black real bod-
ies. Keep in mind that while this clearly showed the bulls had
taken full control from the bears, it does not signify the extent
of the move following the bullish engulfing pattern. Candles,
while unexcelled at sending out early reversal signals, do not
provide price targets. This is why Western technicals are so

| important, as they can be used to help forecast price targets.
This is an aspect we will look at in Part 2.
Exhibit 4.20. Citibank---Daily (Bearish Engulfing Pattern)

---

48 Part 1 © The Basics
In Exhibit 4.20 a rally that began at area A hesitated for a few
sessions in late March near $43.50 with some long upper shad-
ows and a doji. With a push over this five-day resistance area,
as the Japanese would say, "The dirt was blown away." The
rally resumed in earnest until it was short-circuited at the bear-
ish engulfing pattern on April 13 and 14. Note the extreme size
of the black real body of that pattern. This underscored how the
bears had wrested control of the market from the bulls. This
bearish engulfing pattern was confirmed as resistance a few
weeks later with the emergence of another bearish engulfing
pattern. This echoed the fact that each time the bulls were able
to propel the stock toward $51.50, they couldn't hold control of
the market.

Let's look at these two bearish engulfing patterns and com-
} pare them to a Western outside reversal session. In a Western
/ outside reversal session (I'll focus on a top outside reversal ses-
/ sion), the market makes a new high for the move and then clos-
es the next day under the previous day's close. The first bearish
engulfing pattern, if in bar chart form, would also be a tradi-
tional Western outside reversal day since the stock made a new
high for the move with the top of the black candle session and

then closed under the prior day's close.
Now, let's look at the second bearish engulfing pattern in late
April. Note how the second candle in that bearish engulfing
pattern failed to obtain a new high (its high was $51 and the
prior session's high was $51.75). Consequently, if this was a tra-
ditional bar chart, it would not have been a reversal signal via
an outside reversal session (since it didn't make a new high).
But with a candle chart, all that is needed for the bearish
engulfing pattern is for a black real body to wrap around a
white real body, which is what happened in this instance. This
is a good example of how the candles will provide a timing
advantage on those who just use traditional bar chart analysis.
In Exhibit 4.21 a bearish engulfing pattern in early July took
the force out of the preceding rally. This bearish engulfing pat-
tern became resistance for the next week and a half. Once Cisco
closed over the highs of this bearish engulfing pattern on July 15,
it was a bullish breakout (even though it was a doji, the fact that
it was a new high close is a positive). For those who are momen-
tum players, the break above a bearish engulfing pattern could

be viewed as an indication of a new upleg and a time to consid-
er buying. To confirm a breakout, I recommend waiting for a
close over that resistance area, not just in intraday break. Another
bearish engulfing pattern was completed on July 21 became
resistance that was tested in late August. Notice as Prices
approached the bearish engulfing pattern's resistance area, a
group of small real bodies reflected hesitation.
DARK-CLOUD COVER
Our next reversal pattern is the dark-cloud cover (see Exhibit ----~- resistance
4.22). It is a dual-candle pattern that is a top reversal after an i |
uptrend or, at times, at the top of a congestion band. The first | |
day of this two-candle pattern is a strong white real body. The | i | |
second day's price opens above the prior session's high (that is, |
above the top of the upper shadow). However, by the end of the |
second day's session, the market closes deeply within the prior Exhibit 4.22. Dark-Cloud
day's white body. The greater the degree of penetration into the Cover

THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTIVE STOPS
One of the more powerful aspects of technical analysis is that it can be
used as a mechanism for a risk and money management approach to
trading. Defining risk means using protective stops to help protect
against unanticipated adverse price movements.
A stop should be placed at the time of the original trade, since this
is when one is most objective. Stay in the position only if the market
performs according to expectations. If subsequent price action either
contradicts or fails to confirm these expectations, it is time to exit. If
the market moves opposite to the chosen position, you may think,
"Why bother with a stop? It is just a short-term move against me."
Thus, you stubbornly stay with the position in the hope the market will
turn in your direction. Remember two facts:
1. All long-term trends begin as short-term moves.
2. There is no room for hope in the market. The market goes its own
way without regard to you or your position.
The market does not care whether you own it or not. The one thing
‘ worse than being wrong is staying wrong. Lose your opinion, not your
_ money. Be proud of the ability to catch mistakes early. Getting stopped
out concedes a mistake. People hate to admit mistakes since pride and
| prestige get involved. Good traders will not hold views too firmly. It has
| been said that famous private investor Warren Buffet has two rules:
1. Capital preservation. :
2. Don't forget rule 1. _ oe oe!
oS Stops are synonymous with rule 1. You have limited resources. These
resources should be maximized, or at a minimum, preserved. If you are
in a market that has moved against your position, it is time to exit and
find a better opportunity. Think of a stop as a cost of doing business.
Since so much of the Japanese candle terminology is grounded on
military terminology, we will look at stops in this context as well. Each
trade you make is a battle---and you will have to do what even the
_ greatest generals have to do: Make temporary, tactical retreats. A gen-
-eral's goal is to preserve troops and munitions. Yours is to save capital
_ and equanimity. Sometimes you must lose a few battles to win the war. -
| The Japanese have a saying, "A hook's well lost to catch a salmon." If
you are stopped out, think of it as you would a lost hook. Maybe you
| will catch your prize with the nexthook, sss
white real body, the more likely this is a top. Some Japanese
technicians require more than a 50-percent penetration of the
black session's close into the white real body. If the black can-
dle does not close below the halfway point of the white candle-
stick, it may be best to wait for more bearish confirmation fol-

lowing the dark-cloud cover. In some circumstances I will also
view it as a dark-cloud cover even if the open is over the prior
session's close instead of the prior session's high.

The rationale behind this bearish pattern is readily
explained. On the first session of the dark-cloud cover, the mar-
ket is ascending with a strong white candle. This is followed by
a gap higher on the next session's opening. Thus far, the bulls
are in complete control. But then the whole technical picture
changes as, on the second day of this pattern, the market clos-
es not only beneath the prior close, but well within the prior
day's real body, offsetting much of the gain of the first session.
In such a scenario, the longs will have second thoughts about
their position. Those who were waiting for selling short now
have a benchmark to place a stop---at the new high of the sec-
ond day of the dark-cloud cover pattern.

Some factors intensifying the importance of dark-cloud cov-

| ers include:

1. The greater the penetration of the black real body's close into
| the prior white real body, the greater the chance for a top. (If
the black real body covers the prior day's entire white body,

it would be a bearish engulfing pattern rather than a dark-
cloud cover.) Think of the dark-cloud cover as a partial solar
eclipse blocking out part of the sun (that is, covers only part
of the prior white body). The bearish engulfing pattern can
be viewed as a total solar eclipse blocking out the entire sun
(that is, covers the entire white body). A bearish engulfing
pattern, consequently, can be a more meaningful top rever-
sal. If a long white real body closes above the highs of the
dark-cloud cover, or the bearish engulfing pattern it could
presage another rally.

2. During a prolonged ascent, if there is a strong white day that
opens on its low (that is, a shaven bottom) and closes on its
high (that is, a shaven head) and the next day reveals a long
black real body day, opening on its high and closing on its
low, then a shaven head and shaven bottom black day has
occurred.

3. If the second body (that is, the black body) of the dark-cloud
cover opens above a major resistance level and then fails, it

would prove the bulls were unable to take control of the mar-
ket.

4. If, on the opening of the second day, there is very heavy vol-
ume, then a buying blow off could have occurred. For exam-
ple, heavy volume at a new opening high could mean that
many new buyers have decided to jump aboard ship. Then
the market sells off. It probably won't be too long before this
multitude of new longs (and old longs who have ridden the
uptrend) realize that the ship they jumped onto is the Titanic.
For futures traders, very high opening interest can be anoth-
er warning.

Just as a bearish engulfing pattern can be resistance, so too
the highest high of the two sessions that formed the dark-cloud

cover should be resistance. This is shown in Exhibit 4.22.

A dark-cloud cover in Exhibit 4.23 stopped a rally. The day

| after this pattern, Intel pushed up and failed near the high of
this pattern near $71. The stock stalled again near $71 a week

| and then two weeks later. Observe how Intel poked its head
above the resistance line on January 20, but the failure to close

over the resistance keeps resistance intact.

Exhibit 4.24. Wolverine Tube---Daily (Dark-Cloud Cover)
In Exhibit 4.24 we see a rally that began mid August. On
August 22 the stock gapped higher and formed a hanging man
session, but its potential bearish implications were not con-
firmed the next session since the next day's close was over the
hanging mans real body. The stock had a final push with a gap
higher opening on August 28 at $43.25. On that opening it
looked fine from the bulls' perspective. It closed down at $40.62
by the end of that session. This completed a dark-cloud cover
since the black candle pulled well into the prior session's white
real body.
While this was a well-defined dark-cloud cover, from a
risk----reward perspective it may not have been a good place to
sell. This is because the dark-cloud cover was finalized on the
close of the second day of the pattern, and by then it was well
off its highs. Using the concept of the dark-cloud cover as
potential resistance, one could wait for a bounce to near the
dark-cloud cover to sell (assuming this occurs). In early
October a rally to the high of the dark-cloud cover showed
signs of running out of steam with a small black real body and

the same highs for four consecutive sessions at $43.25. The
decline from early October ended with a hammer that con-
firmed a late September support area.

Dual bullish engulfing patterns at 1 and 2 in Exhibit 4.25
underscored the solidity of support in the 3275/3250 area. The
rally from the second bullish engulfing pattern hesitated at the

our market view changes from positive to a more cautionary

support completed another dark-cloud cover. This second black candle

PIERCING PATTERN
As is true with most candle patterns, for each bearish pattern
there is an opposite bullish pattern. So it is with the bearish
dark-cloud cover. The dark-cloud cover's counterpart is the
bullish piercing pattern (see Exhibit 4.26). The piercing pattern is
composed of two candles in a falling market. The first candle is
a black real body day and the second is a white real body. This
white candle opens lower, ideally under the low of the prior
black day. Then prices rebound to push well into the black can-
dle's real body.
The piercing pattern is akin to the bullish engulfing pattern.
In the bullish engulfing pattern, the white real body engulfs the
entire previous black real body. For the piercing pattern, the |
white real body pierces, but does not wrap around, the prior J
| black body. In the piercing pattern, the greater the degree of
/ penetration into the black real body, the more likely it will
become a bottom reversal. An ideal piercing pattern will have a 0
white real body that pushes more than halfway into the prior I
session's black real body. The psychology behind the piercing Exhibit 4.27. On-Neck
pattern is as follows: The market is in a downtrend. The bear- Pattern
ish black real body reinforces this view. The next session the
market opens lower via a gap. The bears are watching the mar-
ket with contentment. Then the market surges toward the close, |
managing not only to close unchanged from the prior day's |
close, but sharply above that close. The bears will be second- |
guessing their position. Those who are looking to buy would I
say new lows could not hold and could view it as an opportu-
nity to buy. |
The piercing pattern signal increases in importance based on Exhibit 4.28. In-Neck
the same factors 1 through 4 as with the dark-cloud cover, but Pattern
in reverse. (See previous section.) With the dark-cloud cover we
would like to see the black real body closing more than midway |
in the prior white candlestick. But there is some flexibility to |
this rule. There is less flexibility with the piercing pattern. The |
piercing pattern's white candlestick should push more than oo
halfway into the black candlestick's real body. The reason for [
less latitude with the bullish piercing pattern than with the |
bearish dark-cloud cover pattern is the fact that the Japanese Exhibit 4.29. Thrusting
have three other patterns called the on-neck, the in-neck, and the Pattern

thrusting pattern (see Exhibits 4.27 to 4.29). They have the same
basic formation as the piercing pattern. The difference among
them is in the degree of penetration by the white candle into the
black candle's real body. The on-neck pattern's white candle
(usually a small one) closes near the low of the previous ses-
sion. The in-neck pattern's white candle closes slightly into the
prior real body (it should also be a small white candle). The
thrusting pattern should be a longer white candle that is
stronger than the in-neck pattern, but still does not close above
the middle of the prior black real body.
It's not important to remember the individual patterns in
Exhibits 4.27 to 4.29. Instead, just remember the concept that
the white candle should push more than halfway into the black
candle's real body to send out a more potent bottom reversal
| signal.
A series of long lower shadows shown in Exhibit 4.30 at areas
1 and 2 denoted potential support near $56. But on September
8 Dayton-Hudson pummeled through this support as it opened
near $54. The bears had gained control---or so they thought. By
| the end of September 8, the bulls had successfully propelled the

stock to well above the prior session's close. The candle lines of
September 7 and 8 built a piercing pattern. A week after the
piercing pattern, a hammer on September 16 reinforced the pat-
tern's support near $54. More confirmation emerged the week
after the hammer with a series of long lower shadows.
A rally that started from a bullish engulfing pattern in mid
March in Exhibit 4.31 displayed a hint of trouble with the
March 24 spinning top near $59. A close over $59 on April 3
with a long white real body put the bulls back in charge, at least
until the next session. On this session (April 4) the stock formed
a variation of a dark-cloud cover. It was a variation of the dark-
cloud cover because with that pattern we like to see an open on
the second day above the prior session's high. In this case, the
open was above the prior day's close. Nonetheless, since the
| black candle on April 4 pulled so deeply into the white candle's
/ real body, it increased the likelihood that this would be as effec-
/ tive as a more traditional dark-cloud cover.
The piercing pattern on April 17 and 18 presaged a rally. The
rally from this piercing pattern continued until another dark-
cloud cover on April 24 and 25. This second dark-cloud cover

could also be viewed as a variation of a classic dark-cloud
cover. Why? Because the black real body did not push more
than halfway into the white real body. Once again, while this
wasn't a classic dark-cloud cover, there were two factors that
led me to believe it was just as negative as a traditional dark-
cloud cover. Specifically, (1) the black candle on April 25
opened sharply above the prior day's high and then closed
under the prior day's close, and (2) this pattern was also a fail- .
ure, and hence confirmation of resistance at the early April
dark-cloud cover.
This chart highlights the general concept that one should
view a non-ideal candle pattern by (1) how it was formed and
(2) within the overall market picture. These two factors will
help us gauge if the less-than-perfect pattern could have the
same implications as a more classicly defined candle pattern. It
is this subjectivity that makes computer recognition of candle
patterns so difficult. For example, the two dark-cloud covers
discussed in this exhibit did not meet the classic definition of
the dark-cloud cover, but I viewed them as dark-cloud covers

because of how and where they were formed, as discussed in
the prior paragraph.

With a piercing pattern that doesn't push deeply into the
prior black candle, I usually suggest waiting for confirmation
with a higher close the session after the white candle. In Exhibit
4.32, late in the morning of March 31, a white candle pushed
into the black candle. Since it did not close above the middle
black candle, it wasn't a piercing pattern. It was a thrusting pat-
tern. The higher close the session after this thrusting pattern
helped reinforce that this could be a bottoming signal. Late in
the session of March 31 another thrusting pattern was formed
near $117. Normally with a thrusting pattern (as we saw earli-
er that day) one should wait for some bullish confirmation. But
with this second thrusting pattern, because it confirmed a prior
support area, one would need less bullish confirmation (i.e.,

. less reason to wait for higher close the next session). As such,
/ for active momentum traders, the close of the white candle of
the second thrusting pattern could have been used as a buying
opportunity. An exit signal was given with the bearish engulf-
| ing pattern early the next morning.

One cannot be too cautious.
Or group of fascinating reversal patterns is those that
include stars. A star is a small real body (white or black)
that gaps away from the large real body preceding it (see
Exhibit 5.1). In other words, the star's real body can be within
the prior session's upper shadow; all that is needed is that the
real bodies don't overlap (there are some exceptions to this Re be 1, wal bodies

rule, which are addressed later in this section). If the star is a black) aa

trend may be ending. In Uptrend | tn Downtrend

Uptrend and a Downtrend This means the market is vulnerable to a setback.
The same is true, but in reverse, for a star in a downtrend
(sometimes a star during a downtrend is labeled a raindrop).
The long black candle during the downtrend visually reflects
that the bears are in command. A change is seen in the advent
of the star, which signals an environment in which the bulls
and the bears are more in equilibrium. In other words, the
downward energy has thus been cooled. This is not a favorable
/ scenario for a continuation of the bear market.
/ The star is part of four reversal patterns including:
1. the morning star;
2. the evening star;
3. the doji stars; and
4. the shooting star.
THE MORNING STAR
The morning star (Exhibit 5.3) is a bottom reversal pattern. Its
name is derived because, like the morning star (the nickname
for the planet Mercury) that foretells the sunrise, it presages
higher prices. There are three candle lines comprising this pat-
tern:
| * Candle 1. An extended black real body. This pictorially proves
| | | | that the bears are in command.
| | ¢ Candle 2. A small real body that doesn't touch the prior real
| body (these two lines comprise a basic star pattern). The
oe small real body means sellers are losing the capacity to drive
black oo the market lower.

black candle. This is the indication that the bulls have seized
control.
The lowest low of the three lines that form this pattern
should be support as shown by the dashed line in Exhibit 5.3.
An ideal morning star would have a gap between the second
and third real bodies. From my experience, a lack of a gap does
not seem to weaken the power of this formation. The decisive
factor is that the second candle should be a spinning top and
the third candle pushes well into the black candle.
Exhibit 5.4 is an example of this. In late July/early August we
see three candle lines that make up the requisite criteria of a
morning star: a long black candle, a small real body, and then a
tall white candle. Of course, this pattern has to follow a decline.
| An aspect that kept this from an ideal morning star pattern was
that the third real body wrapped around the second candle.
However, from my experience, even if the second and third
candles overlap, it doesn't mitigate the effectiveness of this pat-
tern. In fact, the second and third lines of this morning star pat-
tern created a bullish engulfing pattern.

This chart is also a good example of how candle charts will
frequently give turning signals before the more traditional sig-
nals derived from a bar chart. A bear channel that began in
February remained in force until the third quarter that year.
The close over the top of the bear channel was the traditional
Western signal that the downtrend had been broken. By using
the light of the candles (via the morning star), we had obtained
an early warning beacon of a turn many sessions prior to the
break over the bear channel.

A limitation with the morning star is that since this is a
three-candle pattern, one has to wait until the close of the
third session to complete the pattern. As is usually the case, if
this third candle is a tall white one, we would get the signal
well after the market already had a sharp bounce. In other

/ words, the completion of the morning star may not present an
/ attractive risk/reward trading opportunity. An option is wait-
: ing for a correction to the morning star's support area to start
nibbling from the long side. As shown in Exhibit 5.5, there
was a morning star in early February. If one bought on the
completion of this pattern near $74, by the next day he or she
would have had a loss. By waiting for a correction to any-
where near the low of the morning star (toward $65.50) before
buying, a trader would decrease his or her risk since the stop
would be under the low of the morning star. As this stock
ascended, it did so along a rising support line. (Trend lines are
the focus of Chapter 11.)

While the ideal morning and evening stars should have none
of their three real bodies touching, there is even more flexibili-
ty to the definition of the morning star (and also the evening
star) in markets where the open and close are either the same or
close to one another. This would include:

1. Foreign exchange markets where there is no official open and
close.

2. Many indexes such as the Semi-Conductor or Drug Indexes.

3. Intraday charts. For instance, on a 15-minute chart the open
of a 15-minute session is usually not much different from the
close of the prior 15-minute session.
