detailed in Part 2 of this book (where the focus is on Western
charting tools), a rising resistance line can be an area of supply.
When price intersected this line on May 13 we received visual
confirmation that supply was overcoming demand with that
candle's bearish upper shadow and then completing a harami.
| Observe also how the prior price peak on April 12 and 13 was
also a harami. Hammers at 1 and 2 gave signs of stabilization. \
TWEEZERS TOPS AND BOTTOMS | |
Tweezers are two or more candle lines with matching highs or | |
lows. They are called tweezers tops and tweezers bottoms because EXHIBIT 6.8. Tweezers
they are compared to the two prongs of a tweezers. In a rising Top and Harami Cross
market, a tweezers top is formed when the two or more con-
secutive highs match. In a falling market, a tweezers bottom is
made when two or more successive lows are the same. The
tweezers could be composed of real bodies, shadows, and/or |
doji. Ideally the tweezers should have a long first candle and a |
small real body as the next session. This shows that whatever |
force the market had on the first session (bullish force with a |
long white candle and bearish force with a long black candle), EXHIBIT 6.9. Tweezers
it was dissolving with the following small real body with the Top and Hanging Man
same high (for a tweezers top) or same low (for a tweezers bot-
tom). If there is a bearish (for a top reversal) or a bullish (for a
bottom reversal) candle signal that is also a tweezers top, it i l
adds more importance to the pattern. |
Let's look at Exhibits 6.8 to 6.13 in detail: |
¢ Exhibit 6.8 shows how, during an ascent, a long white line is |
followed by a doji. This two-candle pattern, a harami cross Top and Shooting Star
with the same high, can be a significant warning.
¢ Exhibit 6.9 illustrates a tweezers top formed by a long white
candle and a hanging man line. If the market opens, and
especially closes, under the hanging man's real body, odds \
are strong that a top has been reached. This two-line mixture |
can also be considered a harami. As such, it would be a top |
reversal pattern during an uptrend. |

e As mentioned earlier, an ideal tweezers would have as its

| second session not only the same high, but also a small real
| | body. In Exhibit 6.11 the second candle is not a small real
I body. However, this second session completes a variation on

the dark-cloud cover (the second day opens above the prior

EXHIBIT 6.12. Tweezers day's close instead of above the prior day's high). The black

Bottom and Hammer candle session's high also just touches the prior period's high

and then falls. Because of this last fact---that is, both sessions

have the same highs---it adds more negative impact to this

| variation of the dark-cloud cover.
| e Exhibit 6.12 shows a hammer session that successfully tests
| the prior long black candlestick's lows. The hammer, and the
successful test of support, proves that the sellers are losing

control of the market. This two-line combination is also a

EXHIBIT 6.13. Tweezers harami. This would be another reason to view this action as

Bottom and Piercing support.

Pattern ¢ Exhibit 6.13, while it doesn't have a small real body for the
| second candle, does complete a variation on the bullish
piercing line. (A true piercing line would open under the

prior day's low. Here it opened under the prior day's close.)

Because of this I view it also as a tweezers bottom.

These examples of tweezers are not inclusive. They are rep-
resentative of how top and bottom tweezers should be con-
firmed by other candlestick indications so as to be valuable
forecasting tools.

Tweezers should be viewed differently for daily, intraday,
and weekly or long charts. This is because there is nothing
potent about having the same highs or lows for two daily or
intraday sessions. It's only if these sessions also meet the spe-
cific criteria for a tweezers (the first long, the second short, or a
candle pattern with the same highs or same lows) does it war-
rant attention. As such, the main aspect to keep in mind with
tweezers on a daily or intraday chart is that it takes a special
combination of candle lines to warrant acting upon tweezers.

For those who want a longer time perspective, tweezers tops
and bottoms on the weekly and monthly candlestick charts
made by consecutive candlesticks could be important reversal
patterns. This would be true even without other candle confir-
mation because, on a weekly or monthly chart, for example, a
weekly low this week that successfully holds last week's lows

a SCO I
Chapter 6 © More Reversal Patterns 89
could be a base for a rally. The same can't be said of daily or
intraday lows.

Exhibit 6.14 shows the tweezers bottom. Note that the second
real body of this tweezers was not within the first real body and
as such was not a harami pattern. The long white candle after
this tweezers on June 1 was immediately followed by a small
real body with about the same high near $59.50. As such, the
June 1 and June 2 combination can be viewed as the tweezers
top. But in the context of the overall technical picture, the mar-
ket was not overextended and, as such, not so vulnerable to a
correction as should be the case if we had a tweezers top in an
overbought environment. Even if one acted upon the June 1
and June 2 tweezers top (it was also a harami), once the market
closed above the high of these two sessions on June 3, any

| potential bearish implication of the tweezers top was negated.

In Exhibit 6.15 a series of falling gaps (gaps are called "win-
dows" in candle charts; windows are discussed in detail in
Chapter 7) at 1, 2, and 3 kept the bearish momentum in force. A
tweezers bottom unfolded with the second candle of the tweez-
ers bottom a hammer. A dark-cloud cover in the week of the

18th showed that the upward power of the market was dissi-
pating.
Exhibit 6.16 illustrates a tweezers top. Since the small real
body on February 2 was not within the prior real body, this
would not have been a harami pattern, but it was a tweezers
because of the same high at $55. In addition, the small real body
on February 2 was a hanging man line (the upper shadow is
small enough to keep this as a hanging man line). Of course,
this (like any hanging man line) required bearish confirmation
by a close under the hanging man's real body. This occurred the
next session.
Dell descended from this tweezers top until a series of ham-
mers in late February---early March showed an area of stabiliza-
tion. The first two hammers on February 26 and March 1 were
not a classic tweezers bottom. Why? While they certainly have
the same lows, the duel hammers did not meet one of the nor-
mal criterion for a tweezers bottom---having the first candle of
the tweezers bottom a long real body. While the dual hammers
on February 26 and March 1 were not classified as a tweezers
bottom, I certainly would emphasize their importance since

they underscored how the market was rejecting lower prices at
$39 with bullish long lower shadows. As such, I would view
the pattern on February 26 and 27 as a variation of a tweezers
bottom.
While the two candle lines on December 22 and 23 in Exhibit
6.17 did not form a dark-cloud cover (since the black candle
wasn't even near the middle of the long white candle), they did
form a tweezers top. While I would view a dark-cloud cover as
more ominous than a tweezers top (since the regular dark-cloud
cover closes well into the white candle), this tweezers top could
certainly be viewed as a cautionary signal. This was echoed the
next week with the small real bodies and doji reflecting that the
market had gone from a bullish bias to more neutral.
A bullish engulfing pattern at B in Exhibit 6.18 lays the foun-
dation in early February for a rally that continued via a gap on
March 6. As discussed in Chapter 7, the bottom of a rising gap
can become support. The support at the bottom of this gap near
$185 held very well, as attested by the long lower shadow can-
dle of March 8.

BELT-HOLD LINES ere
EXHIBIT 6.19. Bullish
The belt-hold is an individual candle line. The bullish belt-hold is Belt-Hold Line
a strong white candle that opens on the low of the session (or
with a very small lower shadow) and closes at, or near, the ses- eee thenigh
sion highs (see Exhibit 6.19). The bullish belt-hold line is also [
called a white opening shaven bottom. If it is at a low price area | a esha low
and a long bullish belt-hold appears, it forecasts a rally. | |
The bearish belt-hold (see Exhibit 6.20) is a long black candle EXHIBIT 6.20. Bearish
that opens on the high of the session (or within a few ticks of Belt-Hold Line
the high) and continues lower through the session. If prices are
high, the appearance of a bearish belt-hold is a top reversal. The
bearish belt-hold line is sometimes called a black opening
shaven head.
The longer the height of the belt-hold candle line, the more
significant it becomes. The actual Japanese name for the belt-
hold is a sumo wrestling term, yorikiri, which means "pushing
your opponent out of the ring while holding onto his belt."
A close above a black bearish belt-hold line should mean a
resumption of the uptrend. A close under the white bullish belt-
hold line implies a renewal of selling pressure.
Belt-hold lines are more important if they confirm resistance
or other belt-hold lines or if they have not appeared for a while.
In Exhibit 6.21 a bearish engulfing pattern at B indicate poten-
tial trouble. The double bearish belt-hold lines came near the
same area as this bearish engulfing pattern and as such helped
further establish this as an area of supply. Although there were
many bearish signals in this short span (the bearish engulfing
pattern and the two bearish belt-hold lines), it does not neces-
sarily forecast the free fall that occurred after the second belt-
hold. This convergence of candle signals increased the likeli-
hood of a turn, but not the extent of the following action.
A rising gap in early June soon became a support zone as evi-
denced by its successful defense through the first half of June.
The June 13 candle was a bullish belt-hold. On the next retest of
the window in late July---early August, another series of bullish
belt-hold lines formed. These last two bullish belt-hold lines

UPSIDE-GAP TWO CROWS |
An upside-gap two crows (what a mouthful!) is illustrated in EXHIBIT 6.23. Upside-
Exhibit 6.23. It is very rare. The upside-gap refers to the gap Gap Two Crows
between the real body of the small black real body and the real
body preceding it. (The real body that precedes the first black
candle is usually a long white one.) The two black candles are
| the "crows" in this pattern. They are analogous to black crows
peering down ominously from a tree branch. Based on this por-
tentous comparison, it is obviously a bearish pattern. An ideal
upside-gap two crows has the second black real body opening
above the first black real body's open. It then closes under the
first black candle's close.
The rationale for the bearish aspect of this pattern is as fol-
lows: The market is in an uptrend and gaps higher on the open.

The new highs fail to hold and the market forms a black candle.
But the bulls can take some succor, at least, because the close on
this black candle session still holds above the prior day's close.
The third session paints a more bearish portrait with another
new high and another failure to hold these highs into the close.
More negative, however, is that this session closes under the
prior day's close. If the market is so strong, why did the new
highs fail to hold and why did the market close lower? Those
are the questions that the bulls are probably nervously asking
themselves. The answers might be that the market may not be
so strong as they would like. If prices fail to regain high ground
the next day (that is, the fourth session), then expect lower
prices.

Exhibit 6.24 has an example of the upside-gap two crows. The
very small falling gap after this pattern highlighted the bears had
taken control. The rally on the week of February 20 stalled at this
gap's resistance.

Exhibit 6.25 illustrates the significance of viewing a candle
pattern to its immediate surroundings. Although there was an

---

upside-gap two crows in mid July, this would not have been a
signal to sell. This is because, as will be discussed in detail in | | | i
Chapter 7, the stock gapped higher on July 7. A gap up is nor- | ]
mally a bullish sign---whether with candles or bar charts. Thus, |
while the upside-gap two crows sends out a warning, I would
: : : : . EXHIBIT 6.26. Three

view it as less bearish than would be the case in which there Black Crows
was no gap, such as in Exhibit 6.24.
THREE BLACK CROWS
The upside-gap two crows consists of two black candles. If
there are three declining consecutive black candles, it is called
three black crows pattern (see Exhibit 6.26). The three black crows
presage lower prices if they appear at high price levels or after
a mature advance. Three crows are also sometimes called three-
winged crows. The Japanese have an expression, "Bad news
has wings." This is an appropriate saying for the three-winged
crow pattern. The three crows are, as the name implies, three
black candles. Likened to the image of a group of crows sitting
ominously in a tall dead tree, the three crows have bearish
implications. The three lines should close at, or near, their lows.
Ideally, each of the openings should also be within the prior
session's real body.

Exhibit 6.27 illustrates three black crows started April 15. The
descent from the three black crows continued virtually unhin-
dered until the piercing pattern at P. The second and third black
candles of the three black crows (April 16 and 17) opened under
the prior real bodies. While the normal three black crows has an
opening within the prior real body, and these openings were
not in the black real bodies, they could be viewed as more bear-
ish. This is because the second and third black candles opened
under the prior day's close and failed to gain substantial
ground throughout the remainder of the session.

The three black crows would likely be useful for longer-term
traders. This is because this pattern is completed on the third
black candle. Obviously, by the time this occurs the market has
already corrected substantially. For example, these three black
crows started at $70.75. Since we needed the third black candle
to finish the pattern, we got the signal when the stock was at
$67.87.

EXHIBIT 6.27. Pennzoil---Daily (Three Black Crows)

However, in this case we received an inkling of trouble on the
first black candle session of the three black crows. The reason is
that the stock opens above the prior March high of $70, but by
session's close the bulls were unable to sustain the new highs as
it closed back under $70. As you will see in Part 2 of this book,
if the market makes a new high and fails to sustain, it could
have bearish implications. This is what unfolded here.

Let's also look at the prior highs at areas 1 and 2. During time
frame 1 in early February, Pennzoil was ascending to new highs
for the move, but the candles gave us a strong visual warning
flare that all was not well. Specifically, during the latter part of
the week of February 2, although the stock was making higher
highs, higher lows, and higher closes---it did so with small real
bodies and long upper shadows. This certainly showed that the
action was not one-sided in favor of the bulls. The price retreat
ended at the bullish engulfing pattern at B. A rally from there
pushed prices up until the week of March 2, shown as area 2 on
this chart. The rally at 2 was similar to the rally at area 1 inso-
far as area 2 had higher highs, higher lows, and higher closes,

and as such would look healthy if this were a bar chart.
However, from a candlestick perspective, this price ascent on
March 4, 5, and 6 had long upper shadows. This proved the ral- + U =
lying strength was being dissipated. The candle line on March i"
6 was a shooting star. EXHIBIT 6.28. Three
White Soldiers

THREE ADVANCING WHITE SOLIDERS ,
The opposite of the three black crows is three advancing white i '
soldiers or, more commonly, three white soldiers (Exhibit 6.28).
Like much of the candle terminology, this pattern has a military |
association. It is a group of three long white candles with con- |
secutively higher closes. If this pattern appears at a low price EXHIBIT 6.29. Advance
area or after a period of stable prices, then it is a sign of strength Block
ahead.

The three white soldiers are a gradual and steady rise with O
each white line opening within or near the prior session's white |
real body. Each of the white candles should close at, or near, its [
highs. It is a healthy method for the market to rise (although if | |
the white candles are very extended, one should be cautious |
about an overbought market). |

If the second and third or just the third candle shows signs of EXHIBIT 6.30. Stalled
weakening, it is an advance block pattern (see Exhibit 6.29). This Pattern
means the rally is running into trouble and longs should pro-
tect themselves. Be especially cautious about this pattern dur-
ing a mature uptrend. Signs of weakening could be progres-
sively smaller white real bodies or relatively long upper shad-
ows.

If the last two candles are long white ones that make a new
high followed by a small white candle, it is called a stalled pat-
tern (see Exhibit 6.30). It is also sometimes called a deliberation
pattern. The bulls' strength has been at least temporarily
exhausted after this formation. This last small white candle can
either gap away from the long white body (in which case it
becomes a star) or it can be, as the Japanese express it, "riding
on the shoulder" of the long white real body (that is, be at the
upper end of the prior long white real body). The small real
body discloses a deterioration of the bulls' power.

Although the advance block and stalled patterns are not nor-
mally top reversal patterns, they can sometimes precede a price

---

decline. The advance block and stalled patterns should be used
to liquidate or protect longs, but usually not to short. They are
generally more consequential at higher price levels.

As shown in Exhibits 6.28 through 6.30, these patterns can be
at a low price area or during a rally.

There is not much difference between the advance block and
stalled pattern. The main factor to consider with three white
soldiers is that it is most constructive for each of the three can-
dles to close at or near its highs. If the latter two white candles
show signs of hesitation, either with small real bodies or upper
shadows, then it is a clue that the rally is losing force.

Exhibit 6.31 illustrates almost a classic three white soldiers
since each candle, especially the last two, were relatively
strong, opening near their lows and closing at, or near, their
highs. A sign of hesitation came with the doji on April 23 since
it formed a harami cross.

Exhibit 6.32 has a good example of the three white soldiers.
Each of the three candle lines closed very near to the highs of
the session and each white candle opened within or above the
prior white candle. An aspect to consider is by the time the
three white soldiers is completed, the market could be well off
its lows. In this case, Microsoft was almost $4 from its lows, a
high percentage move. Consequently, unless one is longer-term
bullish, buying at the completion of these three white soldiers
may not present an attractive risk/reward.

I have found that on corrections, the first or second white
candle that started the three white soldiers is often support. In
this example, the stock consolidated after three white soldiers
and slowly pulled back until a hammer was formed. That tend-
ed to confirm support within the second white candle of the
three soldiers.

In Exhibit 6.33 a base was forming from mid to late June and
early July near $36.50. Then three white soldiers emerged
(although they had very small upper shadows). After the third
white soldier, the stock hesitated and corrected to the first
white solider of July 11. This chart again illustrates that the
market may sometimes correct after the three white soldiers.
We should expect support as the stock gets to the second, or
especially the first, white soldier.

An advance block pattern is illustrated in Exhibit 6.34.
Although there were three relatively tall white candles, the last

two had bearish upper shadows. This reflected a stalling of the |
rally. Indeed, a series of more upper shadows, labeled as 1 and
2, highlighted this resistance near $51. The long upper shadow
candle at 2 was a shooting star and the next day completed a
bearish engulfing pattern.

THREE MOUNTAINS AND THREE RIVERS
There is a group of longer-term topping and bottoming pat-
terns that includes the three mountains, the three rivers, the
three Buddha tops, inverted three Buddha, dumpling tops, fry-
pan bottoms, and tower tops and bottoms.

Similar to the Western triple top, the Japanese have a three
mountain top (see Exhibit 6.35). It is supposed to represent a
major top. If the market backs off from a high three times or
makes three attempts at a high, it is deemed a three mountain
top. The high point of the final mountain ideally should be con-
firmed with a bearish candle indicator (for example, a doji or
dark-cloud cover). If the central mountain of a three mountain
top is the highest mountain, it is a special type of three moun-
tain called a three Buddha top (see Exhibit 6.36). The reason for
this name is because, in Buddhist temples, there is a large cen-
tral Buddha with smaller Buddhas (that is, saints) on both
sides. This is the same pattern as the West's head and shoulders
top.

104 Part 1 © The Basics

Although the three Buddha top is analogous to the Western
head and shoulders pattern, the theory about the Japanese
three Buddha pattern was used over a hundred years before the
head and shoulders was known in America. (The earliest I have
seen a reference to a head and shoulders pattern in the United
States was by Richard Schabacker in the 1930s. For those who
are familiar with the Edwards and Magee classic book, Technical
Analysis of Stock Trends, much of the material in that book is
based on Schabacker's work. Schabacker was Edwards's
father-in-law.)

It is intriguing how market observers from both the West and
the East have come up with this same pattern. Market psychol-
ogy is the same around the world, or, as a Japanese proverb
expresses, "The tone of a bird's song is the same everywhere."
The three river bottom pattern (see Exhibit 6.37) is the opposite of
the three mountain top. This occurs when the market tests a
bottom level three times. The peak of the troughs should be
exceeded to confirm a bottom. The equivalent of the Western
inverted head and shoulders bottom is called, not surprisingly,
an inverted three Buddha (see Exhibit 6.38).

Area A in Exhibit 6.39 shows hesitation near $124, especially
with the bearish engulfing pattern made in the last two weeks
in November. The retreat from this bearish engulfing pattern

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NUMBER THREE

IN CANDLESTICK ANALYSIS |
| Many of the Japanese techniques are based on the number three. This
reflects the importance of the number three in the Japanese culture.

In premodern Japan, the number three had almost mystical associa- |

tions. The saying "three times lucky" expresses this belief. Other
| examples of three in candle charts include the three white soldiers, the

ominous three black crows, the aforementioned three mountain top |
and bottom and their variations, the three Buddha patterns, the rising |
| and falling three methods, and the three candle patterns of the morn-
ing and evening stars. (Some of these patterns are discussed later.)
Parenthetically, while the number three is regarded as lucky, the
number four is viewed as a foreboding figure. The reason for this
belief is easy to ascertain---the Japanese word for four is shi, which has
the same sound as the word for death. Seat number 4 in a plane of |

Japanese Airlines, room 304 of a hotel---these can hardly ever be |

found (still less in a hospitall). Simply because of the number in

"Renault 4," the Japanese launch of this car failed miserably.' Eng

found stabilization at a bullish engulfing pattern. The ascent
from this bullish engulfing pattern stopped, not surprisingly at
the aforementioned bearish engulfing pattern's resistance near
$124 at B. B was another bearish engulfing pattern. The next
rally in mid May and the subsequent bearish engulfing pattern
at C put a three mountain top in place.
In Exhibit 6.39, the peaks of each mountain were almost the
same. This is not necessary. It is still considered a three moun-
tain top if the three price peaks are not exactly at the same
highs. In Exhibit 6.40, price crested at A, B, and C, with B and
C at slightly higher levels. This would still be considered a
three mountain top. During the last two sessions at C, Intel was
rising with two very small real bodies. This was a symptom of
uneasiness. The price peak came at $76, a shooting star. The real
turning signal, and the confirmation of the three Buddha top,
came with the gap down after the late August shooting star.
While a three mountain top has nearly the same highs, the
three Buddha top has the middle portion as the highest high.
Again we can think of the three Buddha top as comparable to

the head and shoulders top. In Exhibit 6.41 we see a three
Buddha, a.k.a head and shoulders top, with the price peaks at
1, 2, and 3 defining the pattern. The rising line shown on the
chart in Western terms would be called the neckline of the head
and shoulders top. Classically, the neckline of the head and
shoulders top once broken should become resistance. This is
what unfolded with the break of the neckline on August 19 and
then a little rebound on August 21 (and three sessions after
that), stopping at the neckline's new resistance as confirmed by
the bearish upper shadows.

Exhibit 6.42 is another example of the three Buddha top.
Since this pattern is the same as the head and shoulders top, we
can shift into the Western technicals based on the concept of the
head and shoulders neckline discussed in the previous exhibit.

Specifically, once the neckline was broken, it became resis-
tance. The market tried to stabilize with a little bullish engulf-
ing pattern around 13:00, but the failure to push this index
above the neckline resistant kept the bears in control. This
reflects how critical it is to think about where a candle pattern

is formed. In this instance the bullish engulfing pattern is a
potential bottoming signal, but wouldn't it make sense to let
the market close over the neckline's resistance before buying---
even with the bullish engulfing pattern? It does pay to wait,
since such a close over the neckline would help reinforce that
the bulls have more control.

Our Western inverted head and shoulders is the same as the
Japanese inverted three Buddha. That is, there are three lows
made with the middle low as the lowest. This is shown in
Exhibit 6.43 at lows at A, B, and C. Since the low at B was under
the low at A or C, it formed an inverted three Buddha. Note
how once the bulls pushed the pound above 163 with the tall
white candle in early January, that prior resistance around 163
became support. This concept of a former resistance area being
converted into new support is a powerful trading technique
that is discussed in Chapter 11.

Exhibit 6.44 has an inverted three Buddha. Notice once again
how a former resistance area from March near $52 to $52.50
once penetrated became a support zone for most of April.

COUNTERATTACK LINES
Counterattack lines are formed when opposite colored candles
have the same close. The best way to describe this pattern is by | |
discussing the illustrations in Exhibits 6.45 and 6.46. | |
Exhibit 6.45 is an example of a bullish counterattack line. This '
pattern occurs during a decline. The first candle of this pattern
is usually a long black candle. The next session opens sharply
lower. At this point, the bears are feeling confident. The bulls EXHIBIT 6.45. Bullish
: . Counterattack Line
then stage their counterattack as they push prices back up to
unchanged from the prior close. The prior downtrend has then
been bridled.
The bullish counterattack is comparable to the bullish pierc- [
ing line. If you remember, the piercing line has the same two- i | |
candle configuration as that shown for the bullish counterat- | |
tack pattern. The main difference is that the bullish counterat- | |
tack line does not move into the prior session's white real body. |
It just gets back to the prior session's close. The piercing pat- EXHIBIT 6.46. Bearish
tern's second line pushes well into the black real body. Counterattack Line

---

mijn‘

Consequently, the piercing pattern is a more significant bottom
reversal than is this bullish counterattack line. Nonetheless, as
shown in some examples below, the bullish counterattack line
should be respected, since it proves that there is a change in the
flow of direction of the market.

Exhibit 6.46 illustrates the bearish counterattack line. The first
candle, a long white one, keeps the bullish momentum going.
The next session's opening gaps higher. The longs are happy---
then the bears come out fighting and pull prices to the prior
day's close. The bulls' tide of optimism on the second day's
opening probably turned to apprehension by the close.

As the bullish counterattack line is related to the piercing
line, so the bearish counterattack line is related to the dark-
cloud cover. The bearish counterattack, like the dark-cloud
cover, should ideally open above the prior day's high. Unlike
the dark-cloud cover, though, the close does not go into the
prior day's white candle. Thus, the dark-cloud cover sends a
stronger top reversal signal than does the bearish counterattack
line.

An important consideration of counterattack lines is if that
second session should open robustly higher (in the case of the
bearish counterattack) or sharply lower (for the bullish coun-
terattack). The idea is that on the opening of the second day of
this pattern, the market has moved strongly in the direction of
the original trend. Then, surprise! By the close, it moves back to
unchanged from the prior session. In doing so, it changes the
market's texture in one day.

In Exhibit 6.47 on March 10, the stock surged one dollar high-
er on the opening than the prior day's close. By session's end
the whole bullish hue of the stock had changed since the bears
dragged down prices to the prior close of March 7. This bearish
counterattack line of March 10 was the first of three black can-
dles that completed the three black crows.

As mentioned in the section of three black crows, because we
need to wait for three black candles for the completion of that
signal, much of the move may be lost by the time the third can-
dle of the three black crows unfolds. In this case, however, with
the first black candle's counterattack line, we would have
received an early turning signal in one session that was further
confirmed with the three black crows.

EXHIBIT 6.47. Bank One---Daily (Bearish Counterattack Lines)

Exhibit 6.48 illustrates a bearish counterattack line emerging
October 15. We can see that the counterattack did not close
exactly at the prior white candle's close but marginally below
the prior close. With the counterattack lines, as is true with
most candlestick signals, there is room for flexibility in the def-
inition of the pattern. For example, on December 6 there was a
bullish counterattack line. On that session, the stock gapped
sharply lower on the opening and, by session's end, closed
almost, but not exactly, at the prior day's close. I would still
view this as a bullish counterattack pattern, although the stock
did not close exactly the same as the prior close, but certainly
was close enough. The main criterion in this bullish counterat-
tack was the impressive rebound on the white candle from its
weak opening.

In Exhibit 6.49 a bearish counterattack pattern helped con-
firm July's significant resistance near $138-$139. Again, the two
closes were not exactly equal, but close enough to validate this
pattern. This chart highlights how easy it is to use candles to
get extra confirmation of resistance. While this $138-$139 resis-

tance would be available on a bar chart, there is no such thing
as a "counterattack" concept with bar charts. Thus, by substi-
tuting candle charts for bar charts, a trader gets all the bar chart
signals (such as resistance areas) with the bonus of the unique
candle indicators.

A bullish counterattack line is shown in Exhibit 6.50 at the
January 12 lows. This helped confirm a support area in place
since mid December between $25.50 and $27.

This chart also highlights what I call a "cluster of candles."

By this I mean a convergence, or grouping, of candle signals
that reinforce a specific resistance or support area. With this in
mind, let's look at how a cluster of candle signals, denoted by
1-4, reinforced resistance.
1. A shooting star. The next day completed a bearish engulfing
pattern.
2. The black real body that intruded well into the prior white
real body formed a dark-cloud cover.
3. Another dark-cloud cover.
4. A bearish engulfing pattern.

After the clues at 1-4 above, would one think there is resis-
tance between $38 and $39.50? As my 11-year-old son would
say, "Duh." This technique of a cluster of candles underscores
the importance of having a group of signals, whether candles
signals or Western signals, converging at one area to increase
the importance of that specific area. Convergence is the focus of
Part 2 of this book.

DUMPLING TOPS AND FRYPAN BOTTOMS
Dumpling tops and frypan bottoms. Someone must have been
hungry when they thought of these names!

The dumpling top (Exhibit 6.51) is a top reversal that usually
has small real bodies as the market forms a convex pattern.
Confirmation of the dumpling top is when the market gaps
down. This pattern is the same as the Western rounded top. The
only difference is that the dumpling top has the extra bearish
kicker of a gap lower. (A gap down is called a "falling window"
in candle terminology. See Chapter 7.)

| The frypan bottom (Exhibit 6.52) reflects a market that is bot-
toming and whose price action forms a concave design and
then opens a gap to the upside (ie., a rising window). It has the
same appearance as a Western rounded bottom, but the
Japanese frypan bottom must have a gap higher to confirm this
pattern.

I like the concept behind these patterns. With the frypan bot-
tom, the market goes from lower lows to the same lows and
then higher lows. This pictorially proves that the bears are los-
ing a foothold. Then, when you add a rising gap to this sce-
nario, it gives even more proof that the bears have lost control
of the market.

The Japanese will say that with a frypan bottom the market
becomes "immune to bad news." As such, if a market builds a

frypan bottom---especially in spite of bearish news---it would
be very impressive. As Bernard Baruch stated, "What is impor-
tant are not the events themselves, but the human reaction to
these events."

The same is true with the dumpling top, but in reverse. That
is, the market is ascending with higher highs and goes into a
period where the highs are the same, and then goes to lower
highs. As such, the pace of the rally is slackening. Then when
you have a gap down to complete the dumpling top, it just puts
another nail in the bulls' coffin.

Exhibit 6.53 illustrates the dumpling top where the stock is
making a series of higher highs early on August 24. A few 60-
minute sessions of long upper shadows and the dark-cloud
cover at noon on that day gave a minor clue of some hesitation

| near $93.50. The final confirmation came with the lower highs
made on the two sessions after the dark-cloud cover and then
the gap down, which completed the dumpling top.

Exhibit 6.54 illustrates how IBM started stalling the week of
July 12 as it went from mostly white real bodies the preceding
week to black real bodies that were making mostly lower highs.

The gap down completed the dumpling top.

In mid July in Exhibit 6.55 the stock was holding its highs
near $55. But look at how these highs were being maintained---
through a series of small real bodies and even a long-legged
doji on July 16. These spinning tops and doji showed just how
confused this stock really was. The gap down on the week of
the 20th completed a classic dumpling top. As will be discussed
in Chapter 7, when there is a gap down, that gap often becomes
resistance. Note how the gap of this dumpling top (made on
July 24) became an upside barrier a few days later.

In Exhibit 6.56 the July 7 long black candle reflected how
hard this stock was hit. The only mitigating factor was that ses-
sion's lower shadow. But one session's long lower shadow
doesn't change the trend from down to more positive. During
the next few days, a series of long lower shadows echoed sup-
port near $13.50. The appearance of a white candle on July 10
was a successful defense of those lower shadows' support area
that also completed a bullish piercing pattern. With the next

session's higher low, and the gap higher on July 13, this stock
had built a frypan bottom.
| In Exhibit 6.57 a series of consecutive black candles during
the week of July 19 kept the stock under pressure. Some
diminutive real bodies and doji the next couple of weeks hint-
ed that the stock was stabilizing. Final bullish proof of the
breakout from this base came with a very small gap (shown at
the arrow) made between August 5 and 6. As this chart illus-
trates, even if the gap is very small (i.e., a few cents) it is still
considered a gap and thus validates this frypan bottom. The
same would be true with the dumpling top. That is, even if
there were a small gap to the downside, no matter how small,
it would still confirm a dumpling top.
Exhibit 6.58 nicely illustrates the difference between the
Western rounding bottom and the Eastern frypan bottom. From
September 1 through the week of September 14, the stock was
building a rounding bottom (since it was going from lower
lows to the same lows and then higher lows). However, since
this rounding bottom did not have a rising gap, it was not a fry-
pan bottom. Remember, a frypan bottom is the same as a

rounding bottom of the West, plus it has the extract push of a

gap higher. With the aforementioned September's rounding

bottom, we get signs of caution at 1 and 2 with their long upper

shadows (2 was a shooting star).

Let's now turn our attention to activity from early to the lat-

ter part of October. At that time the stock was building a round-

ing bottom (that is, going from lower lows to higher lows).

With the small rising gap on September 26, it became a frypan

bottom with all its inherent bullish potential. Because of the ris-

ing gap in the frypan bottom (that the classic rounding bottom

lacks), I view frypan bottom as more significant than a classic

rounding bottom.

TOWER TOPS AND BOTTOMS

The tower top unfolds at high price levels. During a rally, there

is a short-term lull after one or more white candles. Then one or

more large black candles emerge. This creates a top with a

| long candles on the way up.
| The tower bottom (see Exhibit 6.60) occurs in a descending
| market in which one or more tall black candles keep the bear-
EXHIBIT 6.59. Tower Top ish momentum intact. Then some small real bodies lessen the
bearish tone and finally a tall white candle finalizes the tower
bottom.
The closest Western comparison to the tower top and bottom
| would be the spike, or V, reversal. In the spike reversal, the
| | market is in a strong trend and then abruptly reverses to a new
; qo trend.
‘ Al The tower top and bottom, like some other candlestick sig-
| EXHIBIT 6.60. Tower nals such as three black crows, may be most useful for longer-
Bottom term traders since the tower is often finalized late in the move.
The tower bottom is analogous to the frypan bottom while
the tower top is similar to the dumpling top. The main distinc-
tion between these two patterns is that long black and white
candles are needed for the towers and there is no gap required.
The dumpling top and frypan bottom require gaps.

Exhibit 6.61 highlights the difference between the tower top
and the dumpling top. The stock moved up in the first week of
October with a series of white real bodies and then started
treading water with a series of small real bodies. The gap down
on October 15 formed a dumpling top. Shifting our attention to
late December, we see a series of extended white candles.
Candle line 1 was still healthy, but the small real bodies follow-
ing 1 illustrated that this stock had a poor chance of rising. The
long black candle at 2 was the second "tower" needed to com-
plete the tower top.

In Exhibit 6.62, a hammer in late December hinted of stabi-
lization. The rally from the hammer continued with a tall white
candle on December 29. However, as the stock got within
shooting distance of a resistance area from early December near
$35.75, a group of small real bodies arose. The December 30th
candle made a harami pattern. The harami pattern and the
spinning tops signaled caution. The trend turned more omi-
nous with the emergence of the January 5 long black real body
that completed the tower top.

As discussed earlier, sometimes tower tops send out a signal
late in the move (since we have to wait for a black candle). In
this case, however, the reversal signal a la the harami came
early. Indeed, the December 30 candle was so tiny that it could
be viewed as a harami cross.

A classic tower bottom is shown in Exhibit 6.63. The first
tower consists of an extended black real body on July 28. The
next day's doji makes a harami cross. (Observe another harami
cross at H on July 24 and July 25. Once the index broke under
that pattern, any bullish applications of that particular harami
cross were voided.) The ascent from the late July harami cross
began with a couple of small white real bodies with the longer-
term turning signal arising with the tall white candle on
August 3, since this completed a tower bottom. The rally con-
tinued from this tower bottom until late August when the S&P
staled at the resistance area set by the July 17 shooting star.

In Exhibit 6.64 a hammer on April 1 hinted that the market
was groping for a bottom. The long black candle the next day,

low of the hammer's lower shadow), puts the trend back down.
A series of small real bodies emerged immediately after this
black candle. This mitigates much of the bearish implications of
the aforementioned black candle. The stock's health further
improved with the April 12 long white candle. This was the sec-

ond tower of the tower bottom (with the April 2 black candle
being the first tower).

Although the stock was propelled sharply higher after the
tower bottom, remember that this tower bottom had nothing to
do with the extent of the move. As was discussed before, and I
want to emphasize again, candles are potent turning signals,
but don't give price targets.

An arrow in Exhibit 6.65 points to a long black real body that
propelled the market to a new low for the move. A small white
real body followed this bearish candle, forming a harami pat-
tern. An extended white body followed six weeks of consolida-
tion and thus completed a tower bottom.

CHAPTER 7
1 It Be BH <
Fate aids the courageous.
A! of the candle signals we've seen so far have been rever-
sals. In fact, most candle signals are trend reversals. There
are, however, a group of candle patterns that are continuation
indicators. A continuation pattern is one in which the market
should continue the same trend as that in force before the con-
tinuation pattern. For instance, a continuation pattern follow-
ing a rally means that the trend remains up and we should
expect the rally to remain in force. (This, however, does not pre-
clude a correction after the continuation pattern before the
rally, hopefully, unfolds.)
As the Japanese express it, "There are times to buy, times to
sell, and times to rest." Many of these continuation patterns
125

imply a time of rest, a breather, before the market resumes its
prior trend. The continuation formations reviewed in this chap-
ter are windows (and patterns that include windows), the ris-
ing and falling three methods, separating lines, and three white
soldiers.

WINDOWS
The Japanese refer to what we call in the West a gap as a win-
dow. Whereas the Western expression is "filling in the gap," the
Japanese would say, "closing the window." In this section I will
explain the basic concepts of windows and then explore other
patterns containing windows. Throughout my seminars and in
this book I often use the terms "windows" and "gaps" inter-
changeably.
There are two kinds of windows, one bullish and the other
bearish. A rising window (see Exhibit 7.1) is a bullish signal.
There is a price vacuum between the prior session's high (that
is, the top of the upper shadow) and the current session's low
(e.g., the bottom of the lower shadow).
Exhibit 7.2 displays a falling window. This is a bearish signal
‘ f l in which there is a gap between the prior session's low and the
vm U ' i : ' current session's high.
= Tn pia not It is said by Japanese technicians to "go in the direction of the
| ; a otNindow window." This is because windows are continuation signals.
' Window Consequently, with the emergence of a rising window, one
| should look to buy on dips, and with a falling window to sell

EXHIBIT 7.1. Rising on bounces.

Window It is also said by the Japanese that "corrections stop at the
window." This means windows can become support and resis-
tance areas. Thus, a rising window (as we'll see soon, this
means the entire window) should also be a zone of support on

Top pullbacks. If the pullback closes under the bottom of the win-

| window . dow, the prior uptrend is voided. Note that in Exhibit 7.1, the

the market above the top of the falling window, the downtrend
is done.

There is a belief in the West that a gap is always filled. I don't
know if this is true, but using the concept that corrections stop
at a window, once prices try to fill a gap we can then consider
buying (in a rising window) or selling (in a falling window).

Based on questions from my public and institutional semi-
nars, the most common misunderstanding with windows is
that some will view a pattern as a window if the real bodies
don't touch. For instance, candle lines A and B in Exhibit 7.3
have a large space between their real bodies. However, because
the shadows of A and B overlapped, this was not a window. A
window, as shown in Exhibits 7.1 and 7.2, must have no over-
lap between the shadows. No matter how large the "gap"
between the real bodies, it is not a window unless there is a
space between the shadows.

In Exhibit 7.3 we see a small rising window of only 4 cents
between the high of July 22 and the next day's low. No matter
how tiny a rising window, that window should be potential

| support. The same is true with a falling window as resistance.

Size doesn't matter with windows. The long lower shadows as
it descended toward the rising window's support in Exhibit 7.3,
underscored the demand near that window. Although the ris-
ing window is a potential support zone, as this chart shows, the
market may not get down to exactly (or even near) the win-
| dow's support zone before bouncing. Therefore, if you are
aggressively bullish as a market approaches the rising window,
you can consider buying even if it gets close to the top of the
window and not within the window. How one uses a window
| is dependent on trading style and aggressiveness. There should
be a stop (mental or otherwise) if the market closes under the
bottom of the rising window.

In Exhibit 7.3 we saw how a tiny rising window became sup-
port. In Exhibit 7.4 there is a very large rising window between
$20.50 and $22.50. This gives a $2 zone of support (from the top
of the window at $22.50 to the bottom at $20.50).

As previously discussed, the entire rising window becomes a
potential support zone. The disadvantage with a large window
is that the whole zone is potential support. Consequently, we
don't have so tight a support (with a rising window) or resis-

tance (with a falling window) as one would have with a very
small window.

In instances in which there are relatively large windows,
remember that the key support area for a rising window is the
bottom of the window (for a falling window, the critical resistance

is the top of the window). Consequently, the "last gasp" of sup-

| port with a rising window is at the bottom of that window shown
by the dashed line. In this chart the market touched the window's
low near $20.50 and bounced via a hammer on April 20.

| Let's look at the two other rising windows labeled 1 and 2.
Window 1 held well as support for the next three weeks before
the April 6 candle broke its support. The support at window 2
was broken the day after this window opened. After window
2 was breached, the window at 1 became support. This is how
I sometimes use windows. If, for example, a window's support
is broken, I will look for another window under the one that
was broken as my next support area. In this case, once the win-
dow at 2 was broken, my next support was at window 1.

Exhibit 7.5 shows an example of the importance of consider-
ing the overall technical picture before reacting to a single can-
dle signal. The first candle line on March 1 was a bullish ham-
mer. But more significantly, look at how that hammer unfold-
ed---with a falling window. While this hammer immediately
became a support level, we should remember that because of
the falling window, there is now resistance within that entire
window. The bounce from the hammer ran out of steam at the
top of the falling window.

Note how the window in Exhibit 7.5 was made between the
last candle line of February 28 and the first candle of the next
day (March 1). This is illustrative of a concept with windows on
intraday charts; windows are mostly formed between the last
candle line on the prior day and the first line of the current day.
This is not surprising since it will be unusual, say on a 5-minute
chart, to have a gap from one 5-minute session to the immedi-
ate next 5-minute session.

As shown in Exhibit 7.6, there was a dynamic two-day rally
in late June. The harami cross told us that the stock was sepa-
rating from its prior uptrend. (The July 1 second candle within
prior tall white real body was so diminutive that it could for all
intents and purposes be considered a harami cross.) The ideal
