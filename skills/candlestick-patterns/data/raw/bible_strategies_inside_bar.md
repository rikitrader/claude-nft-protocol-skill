# Inside Bar Candlestick Pattern Strategies

The inside bar candlestick pattern is one of the most powerful chart setups that professional traders look for. However, most traders fail to trade it successfully due to lack of skills, knowledge, and poor education.

## What is an Inside Bar?

An inside bar is two candlesticks:

- **First candle:** Called the **mother candle** -- it is big and large.
- **Second candle:** Smaller and located **inside** of the mother bar (completely contained by the first one).

This is the **opposite** of the engulfing bar pattern.

### Reversal vs. Continuation

- The inside bar is a **reversal pattern** when it indicates that the market trend is likely to change, especially when located at tops or bottoms.
- It is also a **continuation signal** in strong trending markets.

### Statistics (Thomas Bulkowski)

According to Thomas Bulkowski, a successful investor and trader with over thirty years of market experience:

- A **bearish inside bar** in a bull market can indicate a bearish reversal about **65%** of the time.
- In a bull market, it represents a bullish continuation signal about **52%** of the time.
- A **bullish abandoned baby** (as he calls it) is considered a bullish reversal pattern **70%** of the time in bull markets, and **55%** in bear markets.

## Psychology Behind the Pattern Formation

The inside bar formation indicates a **period of consolidation**.

- **In a bullish trend:** It reflects that the bulls are not buying any further on the second day. It is represented by a small black candle on the second day after a strong uptrend.
- **In a bearish trend:** It means that sellers are not in control anymore. It is reflected by a small white candle after a strong downtrend.

Understanding this psychology helps you identify major turning points and time your entry and exit correctly.

## How to Trade Inside Bars in Trending Markets

The inside bar can be traded successfully in trending markets, particularly when the market is moving strongly.

### The Strategy

1. Identify a **strong trend**.
2. Wait for the formation of an inside bar pattern **in line with the direction of the market**.
3. The formation indicates the market pauses before making its next move, allowing you to enter at the right time.

### Entry Rules

- Place an order **after the breakout of the pattern** (after price breaks below the mother candle in a downtrend, or above in an uptrend).
- **Stop loss:** Above the mother candle (for sells) or below it (for buys).
- **Profit target:** The next support or resistance level.

### Important Note

You are not going to take all inside bar signals into consideration. Look for significant patterns that form in **specific areas** such as:

- Support and resistance levels
- Fibonacci retracement levels
- Moving averages
- Pivot points

## Trading Inside Bars with Support and Resistance

Support and resistance levels represent a psychological level where the game is played between buyers and sellers.

### How S/R Dynamics Work

**Example -- Bearish Breakout:**

1. If sellers overcome buyers, they push the price below the support level.
2. Some buyers feel afraid to lose money because the support level is broken, so they exit and sell to cover their loss.
3. Other participants notice sellers are in control and decide to sell as well, pushing the price down further.

### Inside Bar as Confirmation

- When you see a broken support level with bears in control, the inside bar pattern gives you the **right time to enter**.
- The formation of an inside bar after a breakout signals **indecision** in the market.
- If you sell immediately after the breakout (aggressive entry), it is tricky because the breakout is not yet confirmed.
- The **breakout of the inside bar pattern** is a clear confirmation that the market is no longer in an indecision period and sellers (or buyers) are in control.

**Example -- Bullish Breakout:**

1. If buyers break through resistance, an inside bar pattern may form.
2. The inside bar formation means indecision and hesitation -- a false breakout scenario is possible.
3. The best time to place a buy order is **after the breakout of the inside bar pattern**, not after the breakout of the horizontal level.

## Tips on Trading Inside Bar Setups

### 1. Trade Bigger Time Frames

- If you are a beginner, stick with the **daily and 4-hour time frame**.
- Trading on lower time frames increases the chance to overtrade and take low-probability signals, which is the quickest way to blow up your account.
- Focusing on bigger time frames allows you to **set and forget** your trade instead of being emotionally controlled by the market.

### 2. Trade the Dominant Trend

- Start trading inside bars **in line with the market direction**, especially in a strong bullish or bearish trend.
- Never try to trade it against the trend if you are a beginner.
- When you master trading with the trend, you can move to trade range-bound markets and counter-trends.

### 3. Trade Only from Key Levels

- Not all inside bars are worth your money.
- There are **specific locations** where this setup works great.
- Make sure your signal is located at a **key level** in the market.

### 4. Find Different Factors of Confluence

- Trading with confluence means combining different signals to make the best trading decision.
- Look for a point in the market where **two or more levels** are coming together and wait for an obvious signal to form.
- This gives confidence in your approach and allows you to avoid over-trading.

## Trading the False Breakout of the Inside Bar

### The Stop Loss Hunting Problem

Banks and financial institutions know how retail traders trade. They know where you put your stop losses and profit targets, which is why they can easily take money from you.

One of the most famous strategies big players use is the **stop loss hunting strategy**:

1. They drive prices to a level where there are massive stop loss orders.
2. The purpose is to create liquidity (without liquidity, the market will not move).
3. Once stop losses are hunted, the market goes strongly in the predicted direction.

### What is an Inside Bar False Breakout?

This price action signal is formed when price breaks out from the inside bar pattern and then **quickly reverses to close within the range of the mother bar**.

### Two Types

1. **Bullish inside bar false breakout:** Forms when the market is trending down. Also considered a bullish reversal signal near a key support or resistance level.
2. **Bearish inside bar false breakout:** Occurs in a bullish trend. Seen as a bearish reversal pattern near an important level in the market.
3. This setup can also be a **continuation pattern** if traded with the trend.

### Why It Works

- If you enter aggressively before the breakout of the mother candle with your stop loss above it, big players will hunt your stop loss before the market goes in the predicted direction.
- If you understand the inside bar false breakout, you will understand what happened and exploit the manipulation instead of being trapped.

## Inside Bar False Breakout Trading Examples

### Important Levels to Watch

- Support and resistance levels, and supply and demand areas
- Fibonacci retracement levels (particularly 50% and 61%)
- 21 moving average and trend lines in trending markets
- Horizontal levels in range-bound markets

### Example: Trending Market

1. Market was trending down -- sellers are in control.
2. Selling near the resistance level puts probabilities in your favor.
3. The inside bar false breakout gave a good selling opportunity.
4. Place a sell order after the close of the break bar.
5. Stop loss above it.
6. Profit target is the next support level.

### Example: Range-Bound Market

1. Market is trading between horizontal support and resistance.
2. If you entered as soon as the market broke out from the inside bar and the resistance level, you would be caught in a false breakout.
3. The false breakout formed because amateurs tried to predict the breakout early (picking the top), but the market faked them out (forming a bull trap).
4. If you find this pattern and understand that buyers were trapped by sellers, take the trade -- it is very profitable with a good risk/reward.
5. Place a selling order after the close of the break bar, stop loss above it, profit target is the next support level.

## Trading with Fibonacci Retracements

### The Strategy

In an uptrend or downtrend, the market creates impulsive moves and pullbacks. The Fibonacci retracement helps highlight the most important pullback levels.

1. Select the Fibonacci tool on your chart.
2. If the market moves strongly, wait for retracements.
3. If the pullback reaches **50% or 61%** levels, wait for a price action signal to confirm entry.
4. The inside bar false breakout at these levels provides a powerful entry.

### Multiple Factors of Confluence

One signal is not enough. Look for multiple triggers that support your analysis:

1. **The trend** (obviously up or down).
2. **Key Fibonacci ratios** representing a support or resistance level.
3. **The inside bar false breakout** pattern.

This puts the odds of success in your favor.

### In Range-Bound Markets

- If the market is ranging, change your tactics.
- Watch for inside bar false breakouts at horizontal support and resistance levels.
- If amateurs try to predict the breakout early and get trapped, the false breakout provides a very profitable and high-risk/reward trade.

## Benefits of Trading the Inside Bar False Breakout

1. **Stay away from trapped traders** and enter the market when novice traders have to exit with a loss.
2. **Great risk/reward potential:** When big participants surprise amateurs and take their money, the market moves very strongly. You can risk 50 points for 400 points profit.
3. **Predict proper turning points** in the market in advance.
4. **Understand how banks and financial institutions** trade the market.

> **Important:** This strategy is not a holy grail. Be prepared to accept some losing trades. But the risk/reward potential makes it very worthwhile.
