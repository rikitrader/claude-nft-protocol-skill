# Market Structure

One of the most important skills you need as a trader is the ability to read the market structure. It is a critical skill that allows you to use the right price action strategies in the right market conditions.

When you open your chart, you should be able to answer these important questions:

- What are the crowds doing?
- Who is in control of the market -- buyers or sellers?
- What is the right time and place to enter or exit the market?
- When do you need to stay away?

Through your price action analysis, you will experience three types of markets: **trending markets**, **ranging markets**, and **choppy markets**.

## Trending Markets

Trending markets are characterized by a repeating pattern:

- **Uptrend:** Higher highs and higher lows.
- **Downtrend:** Lower highs and lower lows.

You do not need indicators to decide if the market is bullish or bearish. A visual observation of price action is enough to get an idea about the market trend.

### Key Facts

- According to statistics, trends are estimated to occur **30% of the time**. While they are in motion, you must know how to take advantage of them.
- To determine whether a market is trending, use **bigger time frames** such as the 4H, the daily, or the weekly time frame. Never try to use smaller time frames to determine the market structure.

### How to Trade Trending Markets

If you identify a **bullish market**, look for a **buying opportunity** (trade with the trend). If the market is **bearish**, look for a **selling opportunity**.

### Impulsive Moves and Retracements

Trending markets are characterized by two important moves:

1. **Impulsive move:** The strong move in the direction of the trend.
2. **Retracement move (pullback/corrective move):** The temporary move against the trend before the next impulse.

Professional traders understand this dynamic:

- They always **buy at the beginning of an impulsive move** and take profits at the end of it.
- This is why the market makes an impulsive move in the trend direction and retraces before making another impulsive move.
- The best place to buy is at the **beginning of an impulsive move**.
- Traders who buy at the beginning of a retracement move get caught by professional traders and get stopped out before the market moves in the predicted direction.

### Predicting the Next Impulsive Move

To predict the beginning of the impulsive move in a trending market, master drawing **support and resistance levels**.

---

## Support and Resistance Levels

Support and resistance are proven areas where buyers and sellers find some equilibrium. They are major turning points in the market.

### Formation

- S/R levels are formed when price reverses and changes direction.
- Price will often respect these levels (they tend to contain price movement until price breaks through them).
- In trending markets, S/R is formed from **swing points**.

### In Uptrends

- The previous swing point acts as a **support level**.
- When the market makes the retracement move, it respects the previous swing point (support level), which represents the beginning of another impulsive move.
- By drawing a support level in an uptrend, you can predict when the next impulsive move will take place.

### In Downtrends

- The old swing point acts as a **resistance level**.
- When price approaches the previous swing point (resistance level), the market makes an impulsive move downward.

## Trendlines

Another way to catch the beginning of an impulsive move is by drawing trend lines. This is an important technical skill for identifying key linear support and resistance levels.

### What Are Trendlines?

When the market is on the move making new swing highs and lows, price will tend to respect a **linear level** identified as a trend line:

- **Bullish markets** create a linear support level.
- **Bearish markets** form a linear resistance level.

### How to Draw Trendlines

1. Find at least **2 minimum swing points**.
2. Connect them with each other.
3. The levels must be **clear** -- do not try to force a trend line.
4. **Do not use smaller time frames** to draw trend lines. Always use the 4H and daily time frames to find obvious trend lines.
5. In trending markets, use them to identify the beginning of impulsive moves.

### How They Work

- The market respects the trend line.
- When price approaches it, the market reverses and continues in the same direction.
- Trend lines help anticipate the next impulsive move with the direction of the market.

## The Ranging Market

Ranging markets (also called sideways markets) are straight-forward. Their neutral nature makes them appear to drift to the right, horizontally.

### Identification

- When the market stops making consecutive peaks (higher highs and higher lows), the market is ranging.
- A ranging market moves in a horizontal form where buyers and sellers keep knocking price back and forth between support and resistance.

### Difference from Trending Markets

- Trending markets move by forming higher highs/higher lows (uptrend) or lower highs/lower lows (downtrend).
- Ranging markets move **horizontally between key support and resistance levels**.
- In a ranging market, buyers equal sellers and no one is in control.
- This generally continues until the range structure breaks out and a trending condition starts to organize.

### Three Ways to Trade Ranging Markets

#### 1. Trade from Boundaries

- Wait for price to approach support or resistance level.
- Buy at key support and sell at key resistance.
- The best buying and selling opportunities occur at these key levels.

#### 2. Trade the Breakout

- Wait for the breakout from either the support or the resistance level.
- The breakout means the ranging period is over and a new trend will begin.
- The best way to enter is **after the breakout**.
- **Warning:** Range boundaries are often overshot, giving the illusion a breakout is occurring. This can be very deceptive and traps many traders.

#### 3. Trade the Pullback After Breakout

- Wait for a pullback after the breakout of support or resistance.
- After the breakout, the market may come back to retest the broken level (resistance becomes support, or support becomes resistance) before continuing.
- The pullback is your second chance to join the trend if you missed the breakout.
- Pullbacks do not always occur after every breakout, but when they do, they represent a great opportunity with a good risk-to-reward ratio.

### Key Takeaways for Ranging Markets

- A ranging market moves horizontally between support and resistance.
- Focus on the key levels (boundaries).
- The breakout of support or resistance indicates the ranging period is over.
- Make sure the breakout is real before joining the new trend.
- If you miss the breakout, wait for the pullback.
- If you cannot identify the boundaries, it is a **choppy market** -- stay away.

## Choppy Markets

Choppy markets have no clear direction. When you open your chart and find a lot of noise and cannot decide if the market is ranging or trending, you are watching a choppy market.

### Characteristics

- Very tight sideways movement with no clear support/resistance.
- Can make you feel emotional and doubt your trading strategies.
- Performance drops in these conditions.

### How to Identify

- Zoom out on the **daily chart** and take in the bigger picture.
- After training, screen time, and experience, you will easily identify if a market is ranging or choppy.

### Rule

**Do not trade choppy markets.** If a market is choppy, it is not worth trading. If you try to trade it, you will give back your profits shortly after big winners, because markets often consolidate after making big moves.

## Time Frames and Top-Down Analysis

### Primary Time Frames for Price Action

- **1H, 4H, and Daily** are your primary time frames.
- Price action works on bigger time frames. If you try to trade pin bars or engulfing bars on the 5-minute time frame, you will lose money because of too much noise and many false signals.

### What is Top-Down Analysis?

Top-down analysis means beginning with bigger time frames to get the big picture, then switching to smaller ones to decide whether to buy or sell.

### Workflow

**If you want to trade the 4H chart:**

1. Look at the **weekly chart** first.
2. Then look at the **daily chart**.
3. If the weekly and daily analysis align with the 4H chart, take your trading decision.

**If you want to trade the 1H chart:**

1. Look at the **daily chart** first.

### What to Gather from the Bigger Time Frame

1. **Most important support and resistance levels:** These represent turning points. If you identify them on the weekly chart, you will know what is going to happen when price approaches these levels on the 4H chart.
2. **Market structure:** Is the market trending up/down, ranging, or choppy? You will know what the big investors are doing and try to follow them on smaller time frames.
3. **The previous candle:** The last candle on the weekly chart tells you what happened during the week and provides information about the future market move.

### What to Gather from the Smaller Time Frame

1. **Market condition:** What is the market doing on the 4H time frame? Trending, ranging, or choppy?
2. **Key levels:** Support/resistance, supply/demand areas, trend lines.
3. **Price action signal:** A candlestick pattern that provides a signal to buy or short (pin bar, engulfing bar, inside bar, etc.).

### Why Top-Down Analysis is Critical

**Example without top-down analysis:**

- On the daily chart, there is a clear pin bar indicating a bullish signal. You would buy.
- But if you analyzed the weekly chart, you would know there is a very powerful resistance level that will stop the market from going up.
- Result: The pin bar signal fails because the weekly resistance level was a powerful turning point that reversed the market.

**Lesson:** If you trade price action based on one time frame, you will end up losing your entire trading account.

### Counter-Trend Trading

Counter-trend trading is very profitable but requires the top-down analysis concept.

**Example:**

1. Price is at a weekly resistance level, buyers rejected twice, indicating the market is likely to reverse.
2. Switch to the daily time frame to look for a selling opportunity.
3. If a price action setup (pin bar, inside bar false breakout) forms near the weekly resistance level on the daily time frame, it is a high-probability setup.

**For beginners:** Stick with the trend. Practice the top-down analysis with the trend. When you master trading with the trend, you can move to trade high-probability counter-trend setups.

## The Three Questions Framework

When you open a chart, answer three important questions:

### 1. What is the Market Doing?

- Is it trending, consolidating, or choppy?
- If trending: identify uptrend or downtrend.
- If ranging: it is trading horizontally between two boundaries.
- If choppy: close your chart and stay away.

### 2. What Are the Most Powerful Levels?

- Whether the market is trending or ranging, find the most important **support and resistance levels**.
- These levels are the best zones to buy and sell.

### 3. What is the Best Signal to Enter?

- The best signal means the **right time** to execute your trade.
- Use candlestick patterns (pin bar, engulfing bar, inside bar) at key levels in line with the market direction.
