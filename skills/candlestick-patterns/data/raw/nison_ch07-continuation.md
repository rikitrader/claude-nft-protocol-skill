doji the next day (July 2) echoed what was hinted at the candle
line before, to wit, that the market was separating from its trend
| (i.e. up) near $98. A bearish engulfing pattern in mid July was
more proof of trouble overhead.
A small falling window opened between July 27 and 28
(shown as 1) and then another falling window (at 2) on the
29th. This second falling window did the most damage, since it
also gapped under a support area near $95 that had been in
place through the first half of July (this is called a "breakaway
gap" in Western parlance). Not surprisingly, this window, near
$95, became pivotal resistance.
One of the major factors for the remarkable appeal of candles
is that they will often provide signals not available with bar
charts. Exhibit 7.7 shows how we can use windows to get a resis-
tance area not available with bar charts. A hammer emerged on
October 8. This was a potentially bullish sign, but the day of the
hammer was also a falling window. Therefore, one should wait
for a close back over the top of the falling window to corroborate
the potentially positive indications of the hammer.

132 = Part 1 © The Basics

Two days after the hammer, the bulls proved their mettle by
closing above the top of the falling window, and did so with a
bullish rising window. In doing this, the Oil Service Index built
what in the West is called an island bottom. (This is when the
market gaps down, and then within one or a few sessions, gaps
up. The name "island bottom" is derived because one or few
sessions are like an island surrounded by the water on either
side [i.e., the gaps].) While the low of the island bottom is a nat-
ural support area (in this chart it is near 45.50), we can shift to
our candle charting technique of windows to get an even earli-
er support area.

Using the concept that a rising window should be support,

| once the island bottom is completed on October 12 (with the

rising window), our first support is not 45.50 (the low of the
island bottom), but near 49.00 because of the rising window.
This window's support is where the index stabilized for the
next few days before exploding with a long white real body.
This is yet another example of how candle charting techniques
will help get a jump on those who use only bar charting tools,
since those using bar charts would use the bottom of the island
bottom (at 45.50) as first support, rather than the candle's rising
window at 49.00. Of course, if the market had breached the
window's support area, we would look for next support
toward 45.50 (the low of the island bottom and the hammer).

Traditional Japanese technical analysis posits that after three
up or down windows, the chances are that the market is too
overbought to continue ascending (in the case of three rising
windows) or too oversold to keep the downtrend in force (with
three falling windows). This probably has to do with the impor-
tance of the number three to the Japanese. However, I have
fine-tuned this concept since the first edition of this book.

Windows are so dominant that I have found that no matter
how many windows there are, the trend is still intact until the
last window is closed. There could be any number of rising
windows. The trend is still up until voided by the market clos-
ing under the top window. An example of this is illustrated in
Exhibit 7.8. Here we see a rally that started with the bullish
engulfing pattern at B in mid August. Ultimately this rally
opened six rising windows. We got an early clue that the bonds
were losing their breath with the October 5 and 6 harami pat-

tern. But it took the close under the sixth rising window to con-
firm the rally was over. This reversal turned out to be a major
high in bond futures as the market slid for years after.

Exhibit 7.9 is another instance of how a rally can continue
even if there are three rising windows. The rising windows are
shown at 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each of these held as support. The
falling window at A gave an indication of some trouble with
that window acting as resistance at $46. The descent from that
falling window continued until the first week in May.

On May 4 a black real body punctured the bottom of window
4's support at $42.50. This breaking of window 4's support had
potentially further bearish implications for Microsoft.
However, the next day, May 5, a powerful white candle (a
bullish belt-hold line that opened on its low and closed to near
its high) formed a classic piercing pattern. This negated some of
the prior day's bearish implications.

This chart is an example of the importance of adapting to the
changing market environment as we went from a bearish out-

look with May 4's breaking of support to a less bearish view the
next day because of the piercing pattern.

In the next two trading sessions, on May 11 and May 12, a
similar scenario unfolded with a black real body followed by a
white real body. If further proof of major support near $41 was
needed, it came on May 26 and 27 with a bullish engulfing pat-
tern. Indeed, if one looks at the three candle lines on May 29
through June 2, it could be viewed as a morning star pattern
(although classically we like a morning star to come after a
downtrend and not as part of the trading range as it was here).
Nonetheless, this pattern did confirm the solidity of support
near $41.
TASUKI
As shown in Exhibits 7.10 and 7.11 the tasuki are a specific com-
bination of two candle lines that gap higher or lower. The
upward gapping tasuki in Exhibit 7.10 is made of a rising window
formed by a white candle and then a black candle. The black

white candle's real body. The close on the black candle day is | | |

| the fight point. If the market closes under the bottom of the

window, the bullish outlook of the upward gap tasuki is void- Window ~~

ed. The same concept is true in reverse for a downward gapping I

tasuki (see Exhibit 7.11). The market opens a falling window |

with a black candle followed by a white candle. The two can- |

dles of the tasuki should be about the same size. Both types of |

tasuki are rare.

Based on my extra twelve years of experience since the first Gapping Toauld 2

edition of this book, I have recommended at my seminars that

there is little reason to waste brain cells on remembering the

tasuki. The window is so overwhelmingly important that, in

my opinion, it really doesn't matter the color or combination of |

candle lines after the rising window. It is the window itself that | | q

is critical. All one needs to remember is that if there is a rising Window"

window (such as the upward tasuki), it is a bullish signal and | |
the window should be support. A close under this support | l
would turn the trend down. The same is true in reverse for the

downward tasuki. That is, since the downward gapping tasuki Downward Capping

has a falling window, the window should be resistance. A close
over the top of the falling window would void the bearish
implications of the downward gapping tasuki.
In Exhibit 7.12 a diminutive rising window opened late
September. The two candles after this rising window formed
the upward gapping tasuki. It's a tasuki because of the white
candle followed by the black after the rising window. However,
as mentioned above, in my opinion it doesn't matter what the
candle lines look like after the rising window. My main concern
is looking at that rising window as support based on the close.
As shown with the dashed line, that support managed to hold
based on the close. Then, significantly in late October, a bullish
belt-hold line that wrapped around three black real bodies gave
final confirmation of that window's support.
High-Price and Low-Price Gapping Plays
It is normal after a sharp advance for the market to consolidate
the gains. Sometimes this consolidation is by a series of small
real bodies. A group of small real bodies after a strong white
| session tells us that the market is undecided. These small real
bodies, while changing the trend from up to neutral, are in a
sense healthy since, by treading water, the market is then
relieving its overbought condition. If there is a rising window
from these small real bodies, it is a bullish signal. This is the
( high-price gapping play pattern (see Exhibit 7.13). It is called this
a QO ‘ === ~ window because prices hover near their recent highs and then gap to the
| + upside.
| A low-price gapping play is, not surprisingly, the bearish coun-
| terpart of the high-price gapping play. The low-price gapping
EXHIBIT 7.13. High-Price play (see Exhibit 7.14) is a downside window from a low-price
Gapping Play congestion band. This congestion band (a series of small real
bodies) initially stabilized a steep decline. At first, this group of
small candles gives the appearance that a base is forming. The
| break to the downside via a window dashes these bullish
T hopes.

EXHIBIT 7.15. Corning---Daily (High-Price Gapping Play)

During the week of August 21, a series of small real bodies
following a tall white candle showed us that the stock had
reached a lull. The small rising window on August 28 proved
that the bulls had taken full control as the market completed a
high-price gapping play.

The bullish implications of this gapping play, or any high-
price gapping play, would be voided if the market closed under
the rising window that completes the gapping play. The reverse
would be true for a low-price gapping play.

In Exhibit 7.16 we see a tall white candle on June 29. The doji
on June 30 following the tall white candle showed that the stock
had gone from up to more neutral since these two candle lines
made a harami cross. The small real bodies following this doji
just echoed this outlook. Note how at the bottom of the chart,
the tight trading range echoed by the four small real bodies
resulted in the oscillator going from an overbought condition at
1 to a neutral reading at 2. This is an aspect discussed in the
introduction to this section on gapping plays, namely the small
real bodies of the gapping play helped relieve an overbought

reading. With the stock not overbought at 2, it made it easier for
the market to rally. Once the stock opened a small window on
July 7, it formed a high-price gapping play. A dumpling top
unfolded in mid July.
A harami pattern in early April in Exhibit 7.17 helped short-
circuit a rally. The descent from this pattern picked up steam,
especially with the extended black real body of April 15. The
next two sessions' spinning tops gave a clue that the stock was
trying to stabilize. However, the new low close on April 17, and
then the low-price gapping play completing the next session,
showed the bears had regained complete control.
Observe how a small falling window in early May became
resistance. This resistance area was important to keep in mind
because there were bottoming signals with a hammer at 1 and
the bullish engulfing pattern at 2. A trader should be cautious
about buying on either these bullish signals because of the lim-
ited profit potential based on the window's resistance.
Gapping Side-by-Side White Lines
In a rally, an upward-gapping white candle followed the next
session by another similar-sized white candle with about the
same opening is a bullish continuation pattern. This two-candle
pattern is referred to as upgap side-by-side white lines (see Exhibit |
7.18). 1) | |
There are rarer side-by-side white lines that gap lower. These Window _-- te i!
are called downgap side-by-side white lines (see Exhibit 7.19). In | O
spite of the dual white candles, it is still considered a bearish | |
signal because of the falling window. These white lines are EXHIBIT 7.18. Upgap
viewed as short covering. Once this short covering evaporates, Side-by-Side White Lines
prices should move lower. The reason the downgap side-by- in an Uptrend
side white line pattern is especially rare is because black can-
dles, not white candles, are more natural in a declining price
environment. |
Although I have examples of these patterns in the following | i
exhibits, the candle lines that make the gapping side-by-side window", | |
white candles are not critical to remember. What is important is a ft |
the rising and falling windows that are part of these patterns. | |
As discussed in the tasuki pattern earlier in this chapter, I view
it as of minor consequence if there are two white candles (as Side-by-Side White Lee
with the side-by-side patterns) or a black and white candle (as in a Downtrend

with the tasuki) after the window. It is the window itself that
gives us the trend and the support or resistance area.

For example, in the downgap side-by-side white candles, it is
not surprising that this is a bearish signal in spite of the two
white candles. This is because it is the falling window of that
pattern that defines the trend (in this case, down). It would take
a close over the top of the falling window to negate the bearish
outlook of the downgap side-by-side white lines.

The moral of this story: It is not necessary to worry about
remembering the esoteric tasuki and gapping side-by-side
white lines. It is the window that is critical. The combination and
colors of the candle lines after a rising or falling window pat-
terns aren't important. A falling window puts the trend down
and a rising window puts the trend up with the window as
support or resistance.

Exhibit 7.20 shows an upgap side-by-side white lines the
first two days in May. As discussed earlier, it's not so much the
color of these white lines in the upgap side-by-side lines that
make this positive as much as the rising window that opened
on May 1.

Chapter 7 © Continuation Patterns 141
Because this chart has many examples of windows, I will dis-

cuss them individually.

1. A falling window at 1 keeps the trend down. This is in spite
of the fact that it was a hammer on March 26. Usually,
between the window and another pattern, I go with the win-
dow. In this case, it was between a bullish hammer and a
bearish falling window. The bearish outlook engendered by
the falling window takes precedence over the hammer. It
would take a close above the window to have the bullish out-
look hinted at by the hammer to be validated.

2. The small rising window at 2 became support on the minor
retracement from the dark-cloud cover of April 4 and 5. The
doji on April 10 (at the window's support) showed two
things. The first was that the window at 2 held as support.
The second was that the stock was separating from its prior
downtrend that was evidenced by the three consecutive
black real bodies before the doji.

3. The rally that started with the successful defense of window
2 on April 10 stalled on April 23 as Platinum got to the resis-
tance area at $495 defined by the top of falling window 1.
The decline from this resistance opened a falling window at
3. The long black real body on April 25 followed by a small
real body inside that black real body formed a harami pat-
tern. This showed that the bears were losing their momen-
tum.

4. The rising window on May 1 followed by the two small
white real bodies. (This formed the aforementioned upward
gapping side-by-side white candle line pattern.)

After the upgap side-by-side white lines, it became a battle of
windows with the falling window at 3 as resistance (near
$488) and rising window at 4 near $475 as support. We can
see that for over a week the aforementioned support and
resistance areas held intact until April 17 when the demand
was strong enough to push the market over the falling win-
dow 3's resistance on a close. (On April 14 the market
pushed over the window intraday but did not close above
it---thus keeping the window's resistance intact.) From the
break of that resistance, the market ascended briskly until a
harami pattern on May 18 and 21 called an end to that rally.

RISING AND FALLING THREE METHODS
' The three methods include the bullish rising three methods and
| ' ‘ a bearish falling three methods. (Note how the number three
| again makes an appearance.) These are both continuation pat-
| terns. That is, the trend before the bullish rising three methods
should continue higher once the bullish three methods is com-
EXHIBIT 7.21. Rising pleted. Likewise, a bear trend remains in effect after the bearish

falling three methods.
The rising three methods (see Exhibit 7.21) is composed of:
1. A long white candle.
| 2. The white candle is followed by a group of falling or lateral
| small real body candles. The ideal number of small candles
| 0 is three but two or more than three are also acceptable if they
i hold within the long white candle's high-low range. Think
0 of the small candles as forming a pattern similar to a three-
day harami pattern since they hold within the first session's
EXHIBIT 7.22. Falling range. (For this pattern, that would include holding within
Three Methods the shadows; for a true harami they would have to hold with
the real body.) The small candles can be either color, but
black is most ideal for this pattern.
3. The final day should be a strong white real body session with
a close above the first day's close. The final candle line
should ideally also open above the close of the previous ses-
sion.
This pattern resembles the Western bull flag or pennant for-
mation. Yet the concept behind the rising three methods is from
~ the 1700s. The three methods pattern is considered a rest from
trading and a rest from battle. In more modern terms, the mar-
ket is, with the group of small candles, "taking a breather."
The falling three methods pattern (see Exhibit 7.22) is the bear-
ish counterpart of the rising three methods pattern. For this pat-
tern, the market should be in a downtrend. A long black candle
is followed by about three small rising candles whose real bod-
ies hold within the first candle's range (including shadows). The
final session should open under the prior close and then close
under the first black candle's close. This pattern resembles a
bear flag or bear pennant formation.

---

Chapter 7 © Continuation Patterns 143

The ideal version of this pattern has the small real bodies as
the opposite color of the first long real body. That is, for a
bullish rising three methods, there should be small black real
bodies; and for the bearish falling three methods, three small
white real bodies. Nonetheless, from my experience, two and
up to five small real bodies work fine. Also, the small real bod-
ies can be any color.

The ideal rising three methods has three small black real bod-
ies within the entire trading range of a white real body. In
Exhibit 7.23 we see a bullish belt-hold on August 13. This is fol-
lowed by four small black real bodies and doji within the
August 13 high-low range. The close on August 21 completes
the rising three methods pattern.

The challenge we have with a rising three methods is from a
risk/reward aspect. By the time the rising three methods is com-

| pleted, a stock might be far from its most recent lows. In such a
scenario, buying on the completion of the three methods may
not offer an attractive trade. As such, one should think of the
potential profit once the rising three methods is completed com-

pared to its risk (the risk being the low of the white candle that
started the rising three methods).

As shown in Exhibit 7.24 an extended black candle pushed
orange juice to a new low in the first week of October. The next
session, as orange juice got back above 69 cents, it showed that
the new lows made the prior week could not hold. As will be
seen in Chapter 11, when a market breaks a significant support
area (as this market did when it broke beneath the August---
September lows) and then fails to hold the new lows, it often
has bullish implications.

The tall white candle in the second week of November and
the following week's small real bodies demonstrate hesitation
at resistance area from May toward 85 to 87 cents. A group of
small real bodies held within the range set by the second tall
white candle in November. With the tall white candle in
December, we had a rising three methods. (Remember, it is
acceptable for the shadows to get outside of the white candles'
trading range as long as the real small bodies remain in the
white candles' trading range).

| After this rising three methods, the market moved laterally
for the remainder of December until an extended white candle

after the doji (shown as 4) put the bulls back in charge. Some

may have noticed that area A on the chart looks very similar to

rising three methods since the real bodies at 1 to 4 held within

the white candle. Because the rising three methods should have

small real bodies, the long real body at 3 meant this was not
viewed as a rising three methods pattern.

In Exhibit 7.25 on May 30 and 31 as the stock was descend-

ing, it did so with a series of very small, almost doji, real bod-

ies. This makes the trend less negative. The April 1 bullish
engulfing pattern showed that the bulls had now taken control.

Some consolidation in the next four days with alternating black

and white small real bodies and the April 10 candle finalized

the rising three methods pattern.

Let's look at an example of volume in conjunction with the

rising three methods. Ideally, with a rising three methods, the

first and last candles, i.e., the long white, have the strongest
volume of all the sessions that make up the rising three meth-

ods. This would confirm that on each of the white candle days

the bulls had more control of the market. In Exhibit 7.26 the

June 17 tall white candle had relatively strong volume.

Additionally, this candle in conjunction with the prior two days
formed a morning doji star.

The series of small real bodies that drifted lower after the
June 17 white real body were on declining volume. The push
higher with a higher volume lofty white candle on June 24 com-
pleted the rising three methods. This chart is a classic example
of combining volume with a candlestick indicator that can rein-
force the likelihood of the candlestick indicator being success-
ful.

After the June 24 white candle, a black real body formed a lit-
tle dark-cloud cover and caused some temporary hesitation
before the rally resumed. Note also the high volume window
opened July 8. This high volume reinforced the likelihood that
the window, especially the bottom of the window, would
become a support area. (Volume is addressed in Chapter 15.)

In most instances, the rising three methods occur during an
uptrend or lateral trend. Sometimes, however, this pattern
helps define a turning point from a sell-off. Another example of
this pattern is shown in Exhibit 7.27. A rising three methods in
early September helped to underscore the solidity of support

near 7500. The market did not immediately rally after that ris-
ing three methods. While candle signals will often give market
turns, they do not necessarily mean that the market will ascend
(in the case of a rising three methods) immediately from that
signal. Instead, many candle patterns, such as this one, can
reinforce a support area. This is what unfolded with the Dow
near 7500 as support. Additional confirmation of that support
came with the piercing pattern in mid September and early
October and a hammer on October 4.

Where a candle pattern or line appears within the market
picture is often more important than the individual candle
pattern. For example, if there were a bullish engulfing pattern
that is completed near a resistance area, from a risk/reward

| perspective it would not be attractive to purchase on that pat-
tern since one would be buying at resistance.

An example of the overall technical picture and a rising three
methods pattern is highlighted in Exhibit 7.28. A small window
between December 14 and 15 was support during the latter
part of that week. A rally that began on December 20 ran into
some problems near $60 with a harami pattern of December 23
and 27. On the close of December 29, the stock formed a rising

three methods pattern (it had two small real bodies instead of
the classic three small real bodies). But look where this pattern
was completed, at the $60 area---which was resistance since
December 7. Consequently, while the rising three methods is
considered a bullish signal, one should keep in mind that since
it emerged at a resistance area, it would not be an effective buy-
ing opportunity. It took the close above this $60 resistance area
on January 11 to get this market going on the upside.

Exhibit 7.29 shows a falling three methods pattern. Notice
that the first small real body of this pattern on May 18 was out-
side the real body of the prior long black real body. This does
not negate the falling three methods pattern since a requisite is
that the small real bodies should then be within the entire trad-
ing range of a long black candle, not necessarily in the black
candle's real body.

The black real body on May 21, which closed under the close
of the May 17 black real body, fulfilled the conditions for the
falling three methods. A very impressive bounce on May 25 in
which the stock opened sharply lower and then closed about
unchanged from the prior session was almost a counterattack
pattern. Although the white candle's close did not get exactly to

the May 24 close, the intense bounce from the opening to clos-
ing on the 25 would have the same implications as a classic
counterattack.
In Exhibit 7.30, WorldCom broke a multimonth support area
near $38 in the first week of August. A minor rally in early
August managed to put the stock back to the prior support area
of $38. From there it failed. (In Chapter 11, I examine this tech-
nique of old support becoming new resistance.) The price activ-
ity in September formed a falling three methods pattern.
SEPARATING LINES
We examined the counterattack line in Chapter 6. This is a
white/black or black/white combination of candle lines with
the same close as the previous close. Whereas the counterattack
line has the same close, the separating lines in Exhibit 7.31 have
the same open as the previous opposite color candle.
| The separating line is a continuation pattern. It is easy to
see why. During a market rise, a black real body (especially a
relatively long one) would be a bull's cause for concern. The
bears might be gaining control. However, if the next session's
opening gaps high enough to open at the previous black ses-
sion's opening price, it impressively proves that the bears
have lost control of the market---especially if that session
closes as a white candle. This is the scenario that unfolds with
the bullish separating line as shown in Exhibit 7.31. The white
line ideally should also be a bullish belt-hold (that is, open on
the low of the session and close at, or near, the high of the ses-
sion). The opposite would be true with a bearish separating
line in Exhibit 7.31. This is viewed as a bearish continuation
signal. Separating lines are rare.
. While most of us would like to see an ideal version of a par-
i! Seowrane i" ticular candle pattern, even variations of these patterns can also
] | prove useful. Exhibit 7.32 illustrates this. A bearish engulfing
j i pattern in mid August (at B) presaged a decline that culminat-
| | | ed with a bullish engulfing pattern completed on August 3. The
Bullish ‘| two lines following the August 3 white candle was almost a
Yer'sh bullish separating line. This is because the open on August 7

4 and then gapped sharply higher to open almost the same as
the August 4 opening was, undoubtedly, very impressive. If
one needed more bullish proof than this that demand had over-
whelmed supply, it came with the August 9 rising window.

In Exhibit 7.33 bearish separating lines occurred in the sec-
ond week of August. After these bearish separating lines, the
stock stabilized near the early August support area of $29.
Confirmation of a bearish down leg came with the falling win-
dow of August 15.

There were bullish separating lines on September 13 and 14.
These failed to correctly signal a continuation of the rally.
However, this should not be too surprising considering that the
white candle of the bullish separating lines came at $28. This
was a resistance area in place during the week of August 21, as
shown by the dashed line. Once again this underscores that
where one gets a candle signal is a major factor in deciding if
one buys or sells on that signal. In this example, if someone
bought on the completion of the bullish separating lines, that
trader would have purchased the stock at resistance. In such a

scenario it might be more prudent waiting for the stock to close
above $28 for further bullish confirmation.
Although the bullish separating lines are rare, they normally
appear during a rally. There are a few instances, however,
where a bullish separating line can help signal a bottom. In
Exhibit 7.34 a bullish separating line arose on March 24 and 25.
After this pattern the stock hesitated near $43.50. This market's
hesitation came to an end on April 5 as the stock opened a small
rising window above this $43.50 resistance.
Interestingly, the candle lines from March 25 to the afore-
mentioned gap on April 5 formed a high-price gapping play.
The April rally continued until the bearish engulfing pattern on
April 14 and 15.

A sudden danger.
A; described in Chapter 3, a doji is a candle session where
the opening and closing prices are the same. Examples of
doji lines are shown in Exhibits 8.1 through 8.6. The doji is such
a significant reversal indicator that this chapter is devoted to its
manifestations. In prior chapters, we have seen the power of a
doji as a component of some patterns. These included the doji
star (see Chapter 5) and the harami cross (see Chapter 6).
The doji is a distinct trend change signal, especially during
rallies. The likelihood of a reversal with the emergence of a doji
increases if:
1. Subsequent candles confirm the doji's reversal potential.

2. The market is overbought or oversold.

3. The market doesn't have many doji (the plural of doji is doji).
If there are numerous doji on a particular chart, one should
not view the emergence of a new doji as a meaningful devel-
opment.

The ideal doji session has the same opening and closing
price, yet there is some flexibility to this rule. If the opening and
closing prices are within a few ticks of each other (for example,
a few cents in stocks or a few thirty-seconds in bonds, and so
on), the line could still be viewed as a doji. How do you decide
whether a near-doji day (that is, where the open and close are
very close, but not exact) should be considered a doji? This is
subjective and there are no rigid rules. Here are some tech-
niques I have found useful for saying that a doji-like session
would be reacted upon like a classic doji:

1. Compare a near-doji day in relation to recent action. If there
were a series of very small real bodies, the near-doji day
would not be viewed as significant since so many other
recent periods had small real bodies. If, however, a doji-like
session emerges among tall candles, then we can say that
such a session could have the same implications as a doji

---

---
Chapter 8 ¢ The Magic Doji 157
since this session is displaying there is something very dif-
ferent on that session from the preceding action.
2. If the market is at an important market junction.
3. If the market is extremely overbought or oversold.
4. If there are other technical signals sending out an alert.

Since a doji can be a significant warning, it is better to attend
to a false warning than to ignore a real one.

This chapter will address doji at tops, doji as resistance, spe-
cific types of doji, doji and trend, and the tri-star.

Doji are valued for their ability to call market tops. This is
especially true after a long white candle in an uptrend (see
Exhibit 8.5). The reason for the doji's potential negative impli-
cations in uptrends is because a doji represents indecision.
Indecision, uncertainty, or vacillation by buyers will not main-
tain a rally. It takes the conviction of buyers to sustain a rally. If
the market has had an extended rally, and/or is overbought,
and then a doji surfaces (read "indecision"), it could mean the
scaffolding of buyers' support will give way.

A caveat, from my experience, is that as successful as doji are
at calling tops, they tend to lose some reversal potential in
downtrends. The reason may be that a doji reflects a balance
between buying and selling forces. With ambivalent market
participants, the market could fall, as the market saying goes,
"fall of its own weight." This is similar to the idea that strong
volume is more important to confirm an upside breakout than
volume confirmation for a downside breakout.

Thus, a doji in a rally could signal an exhausted market. But
with a doji during a price descent, the market may continue its
fall. Because of this, doji need more confirmation to signal a
bottom than they do a top. For example, a doji that confirms
support should be heeded although it comes during a decline.

To separate a doji during a rally from doji during declines, I
call the former Northern doji and the latter Southern doji (see
Exhibit 8.6). This section will focus on Northern doji. Southern
doji (doji in a falling market) are addressed later in this chapter.

Keep in mind that doji not working so effectively at signaling
bottoms as tops is based on my experiences. The Japanese say,
"The market is like a person's face; never are two alike."
Consequently, for your markets, doji may work well at calling

---

bottoms. This brings out a pivotal point about candle charts in
general. All of the candle lines or patterns may be effective in
your markets, or only some. Seeing which work well comes
with experience.
THE NORTHERN DO})I
(DOJI DURING RALLIES)
The Japanese say that with a doji after a tall white candle, or a
doji in an overbought environment, that the market is "tired."
That is a wonderfully apt way to view doji. A doji may not
mean an immediate price reversal. The doji shows us the mar-
ket is vulnerable, and may be at a transition point.

I received a letter from an attendee at one of my on-site insti-
tutional seminars. The attendee wrote, "You're right about a lit-
tle knowledge being dangerous. We are all running around
shouting ‘doji, doji, doji!'" This comment is not surprising since
doji are so easy to spot. Traders may get so excited about seeing
a doji that they jump on it as a trading signal. But don't make

| more of the doji than it is meant to show. A doji means the trend
may be in the process of changing.

For example, in my advisory service, I provide short-term
trend. When a doji arises, I don't change the market's short-
term trend from up to down, but from up to up/neutral. If this
doji also confirms another technical signal, then I would change
the trend from up to neutral or neutral /down. (This idea of one
technical indicator confirming another is the focus of Part 2.) It
is rare that with a doji itself I would change the short-term
trend from up to down.

In Exhibit 8.7 the spinning tops at A and B were clues that the
trends before these candles were stalling. While such small real
bodies represent a tug-of-war between the buyers and sellers, a
doji is a session in which the bulls and bears are in complete
balance.

During the ascent from B a series of long white real bodies
echoed a vibrant market. The doji, in a single session, shows
that the market is separating from its trend. The doji indicates
that there is something very different on that day (in which the
open and close are the same) from the preceding white candle
lines where the closes were well above the openings.

Chapter 8 * The Magic Doji 159

In this example, after the doji, the index went from up to lat-
eral and then down. However, the appearance of the doji
doesn't necessarily mean the market will descend. Yet, the doji,
especially in such an overbought market, would be reason for
caution. Liquidating some long positions, selling calls, and
moving up stops are all examples of what could be done with
this doji session.

In Exhibit 8.8 the stock retreated from a bearish engulfing
pattern (at B). A few sessions later a lengthy white candle
showed that the bulls have taken control since that line closed

| over the bearish engulfing pattern's $58.50 resistance area. But
the next session's doji changed the outlook. The market went
from one where the bulls were in charge to one where, as
shown by the doji, the forces of supply and demand were in
equilibrium.

Observe how the stock stalled a couple of sessions after the
doji neared $58.62. This brings out a useful technique I use fre-
quently with a doji following a tall white candle. Specifically, I

EXHIBIT 8.8. Microsoft---3 Minutes (Doji after a Tall White Candle)
will take the highest high between the doji session and the tall
white candle (that is, the highest upper shadow). That level
should be resistance based on the close. In this example, the
high of the doji session and the long white candle were both
$58.62. At such, that becomes our resistance area.

In Exhibit 8.9 sessions 1 through 6 had higher highs, higher
lows, and higher closes. Session 7 was the first lower high,
lower close, and lower low since candle line 1. Normally this is
not of great consequence, but since candle 7 was also a doji, it
adds more importance to this aspect. Sometimes the small clues
add up to signal an important market juncture. As the Japanese
proverb says, "The water of even a great ocean comes one drop
at a time." So it is in the markets, where small clues that are not
meaningful by themselves take on more weight when com-
bined with other technical clues.

The dashed line on the chart is our resistance area once the
doji emerged. As explained in Exhibit 8.8, if we have a doji
after a tall white candle, we take the highest high between
those two lines and make that resistance based on the close. In
