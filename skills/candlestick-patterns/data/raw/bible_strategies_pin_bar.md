# Pin Bar Candlestick Pattern Strategies

The pin bar candlestick is one of the most famous Japanese candlesticks. It is widely used by price action traders to determine reversal points in the market.

## Pin Bar Anatomy

A pin bar is a chart candlestick characterized by a **very long tail** that shows rejection and indicates that the market will move in the opposite direction.

- The area between the open and close is called the **real body**. Typically all pin bars have a very small real body and a long shadow.
- A **bullish pin bar** is known for its lower wicks.
- A **bearish pin bar** is characterized by long upper wicks.
- The color of the candlestick is not as important; however, bullish candles with white real body are more powerful than candles with a black body.
- Bearish pin bars with black real bodies are more important than those with white real bodies.

## How to Identify Pin Bar Setups

Trading is a game of probabilities. There is no certainty. You should evaluate your pin bar setups from multiple angles. Looking for quality setups means you are trying to put the probabilities of success in your favor.

### Criteria for a Valid Pin Bar

1. **Time Frame:** Pin bars formed in bigger time frames (4H, daily) should be taken into consideration. Smaller time frames generate too many false signals.
2. **Trend Direction:** A pin bar formed in line with the direction of the market is more powerful than one formed against the trend. Bullish pin bars in an uptrend work and should be taken into consideration; bearish ones against the trend should be ignored.
3. **Anatomy:** Make sure the candlestick is a pin bar by looking at the distance between the real body and the tail. Pin bars with longer tails are more powerful.

### Psychology Behind Pin Bar Formation

Pin bars are formed when prices are rejected. This rejection alone does not indicate a reversal signal because pin bars can form everywhere on your chart. The most important areas to watch are:

- **Support and resistance levels**
- **Supply and demand zones**
- **Moving averages**

If the rejection occurs near a **support level**, it indicates that bulls are more powerful and willing to push the market upward. If it occurs near a **resistance level**, it indicates that bears reject prices and prevent bulls from breaking through, meaning sellers are willing to push the market downward.

## Trading Pin Bars With the Trend

If you are a beginner trader, stick with the trend. Pin bars that occur in trending markets offer good trading opportunities with high risk/reward ratio.

### Strategy

1. Identify a clear uptrend or downtrend.
2. Wait for a pin bar to occur after a pullback to support or resistance level.

### Example Criteria for a High-Quality Setup

1. The pin bar is well formed and in line with the direction of the market.
2. The rejection occurred at a major key level (a hot point in the market).
3. The risk-to-reward ratio is good and worth trading.

### Using the 21 Moving Average

Sometimes, even if the market is trending, you cannot draw support and resistance levels because prices move in a way where you cannot spot static key levels.

- Use the **21 moving average** as a **dynamic support** in an uptrend market and a **dynamic resistance** in a downtrend market.
- When prices approach the moving average, the buying or selling pressure takes place, and the price moves accordingly.
- If the pin bar signal is clear on the chart, the trend direction matches the pin bar anatomy, and the rejection from the 21 MA confirms the signal, it is a buy or sell.

## Trading Tactics

When you have identified the trend (uptrend or downtrend), the level (support or resistance), and found a pin bar near these levels in line with the trend direction, the next step is knowing how to enter.

### 1. Aggressive Entry

Enter the market **immediately after the pin bar closes** without waiting for confirmation.

- This helps you catch the move from the beginning, since sometimes the price goes in your direction right after the close.
- **Stop loss:** Above the long tail (for sell) or below the long tail (for buy).
- **Profit target:** The next support or resistance level.

**Three essential elements:**

- **The Trend:** The market direction (uptrend or downtrend).
- **The Level:** A support that becomes resistance, or vice versa.
- **The Signal:** A clear pin bar formed after the retracement back to the key level.

### 2. Conservative Entry

Enter the market after a **50% retracement of the pin bar range**.

- This strategy sometimes gives you more than **5:1 risk/reward ratio**.
- However, sometimes the market will leave without you because it does not retrace to 50%.
- **Advantage:** Decreases risk and increases reward.
- **Disadvantage:** The market sometimes does not retrace to 50%, and you miss the move.

There is no wrong or right entry option. Both work great. With screen time and experience, you will be able to decide whether to trade aggressively or conservatively.

## Trading Pin Bars with Confluence

Confluence happens when multiple technical indicators generate the same signal. This concept is used by price action traders to filter entry points and spot high-probability signals.

### Factors of Confluence

1. **The Trend:** The most important factor. You cannot trade any setup without identifying if it is in line with the market direction. A bearish pin bar in a downtrend is a more powerful signal than one in a range-bound market.
2. **Support and Resistance / Supply and Demand:** These major levels have significant importance because all big participants watch these specific areas.
3. **Moving Averages:** The 8 and 21 moving averages act as dynamic support and resistance. Very important in trending markets.
4. **Fibonacci Retracement:** The 61% and 50% Fibonacci retracement levels help find the most powerful areas in the market.
5. **Trend Lines:** Drawing these lines gives an idea about market direction and helps find the most important reversal points.

### How Many Factors Do You Need?

You are not obligated to find all these levels. If you can find just **one or two factors** of confluence together with a good pin bar setup, that is enough to make a profitable trade.

**Example:** An obvious pin bar signal near support or resistance level in line with the market direction.

### Four-Factor Confluence Example

1. **The Trend:** Market is trading up -- look for a buying opportunity.
2. **The Level:** Support level is an important key level (resistance broke out and became support, price pulled back to it).
3. **The Signal:** Bullish pin bar formed after retracement back to the support level.
4. **Additional Signal:** Rejection of the pin bar from the support level and the 21 MA that acted as dynamic support.

## Pin Bar Trade Examples

### Example 1: NZDUSD Daily (Downtrend)

- Market is trending down (first information from the chart).
- After breakout of support level (now resistance), price retraced back and formed a pin bar.
- The pin bar near the resistance level indicates the retracement move is over and an impulsive move is likely.
- With the 21 MA and Fibonacci retracement, the pin bar was rejected from these levels, confirming this is a very important area with sellers willing to push lower.

**Reasons to sell:**

1. The downtrend.
2. Pin bar near resistance indicating end of pullback and beginning of new downward move.
3. Rejection from resistance and the 21 MA.
4. Rejection from the 50% Fibonacci retracement level.

### Example 2: Uptrend with Multiple Entries

- Market was trending up.
- First pin bar formed after retracement back to support level -- high-probability entry.
- Confirmed by rejection from the 21 MA and the 50% Fibonacci retracement.
- Second pin bar allowed re-entry to make more profits.

## Trading Pin Bars in Range-Bound Markets

A market is ranging when prices do not make any higher high and higher low and start trading horizontally between a definable level of support and a definable level of resistance.

### Identifying a Range

- Look for at least **two touches of support** and **two touches of resistance**.
- Once you identify the range, trade by going long when prices reach support and going short when prices approach resistance.

### Strategy 1: Trade from Boundaries

- Buy at the support level and sell at the resistance level.
- Wait for a clear price action setup such as a pin bar.

**Entry Rules:**

1. A pin bar rejected from the support level -- buy after the pin bar closes, or wait for a 50% retracement of the pin bar range.
2. Stop loss below the support level (for buys) or above the resistance level (for sells).
3. Profit target at the opposite boundary (resistance for buys, support for sells).

### Strategy 2: Trade the Breakout Direction

- Trade in the direction of breakouts from major key levels.
- Or wait for prices to retrace back to the breakout point and then enter.
- After breakout, wait for a pin bar at the retest level.

### Confirming Pin Bar Signals with Bollinger Bands

The Bollinger Bands indicator, developed by John Bollinger, measures a market's volatility and can be used as confirmation.

**Strategy:**

- Combine horizontal support and resistance with the upper and lower Bollinger Bands false breakout.
- If prices are rejected from major key levels and from the bands, this confirms the market will bounce from these levels.

**Rules:**

- If a pin bar is rejected from a horizontal key level **and** from the bands, it is a clear confirmation to buy or sell.
- Use Bollinger Bands **only as a confirmation tool** in range-bound markets. Do not use it to generate signals.
- Always use it in combination with horizontal key levels.
- The false breakout of a resistance level made by a pin bar, confirmed by a false breakout of the upper band, is a powerful signal to short the market.
