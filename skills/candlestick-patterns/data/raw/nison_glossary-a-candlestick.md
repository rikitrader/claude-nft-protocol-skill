# Glossary A Candlestick

Glossary B ¢ Western Technical Terms 283

Spring---When prices break under the support of a horizontal
congestion band and then springs back above the "broken
support" area. This is bullish and there is a measured price
target to the upper end of the congestion band.

Stochastics---An oscillator that measures the relative position of
the closing price as compared with its range over a chosen
period. It is comprised of the faster moving %K line and the
slower moving %D line.

Support level---An area where buyers are expected to enter.

Swing target---Using the height of a rally or decline to obtain a
price target.

Trading range---When prices are locked between horizontal sup-
port and horizontal resistance levels.

Trend---The market's prevalent price direction.

Trend line---A line on a chart that connects a series of higher
highs or lower lows. At least two points are needed to draw
a trend line. The more often it is tested and the greater the

| volume on the tests, the more important the trend line.

Trend reversals---A\lso called reversal indicators. This is a mislead-
ing term. More appropriate, and more accurate, would be the
term "trend change indicator." It means the prior trend
should change. It does not mean prices are going to reverse.
Prices might reverse after a trend reversal pattern, but they
may not. For example, the trend could change from upwards
to sideways. As long as the trend changes after a trend rever-
sal pattern appears, that trend reversal worked. Thus, if a
trend reversal appears during an uptrend and the market
then trades sideways, the trend reversal pattern was success-
ful.

Upgap---A gap that pushes prices higher.

Upthrust---When prices break above a resistance line from a lat-
erally trading zone. If these new highs fail to hold and prices
pull back under the "broken" resistance line, it is an
upthrust. The target is for a retest of the lower end of the
recent trading zone.

Uptrend---A market that is trending higher.

V bottom or top---When prices suddenly reverse direction, form-
ing a price pattern that looks like the letter V for a bottom or
an inverted V for a top.

Volume---The total of all contracts traded for a given period.

Weighted moving average---A moving average in which each pre-
vious price is assigned a weighting factor. Usually the most
recent data is the more heavily weighted and thus considered
more important.
