# Chapter 02 Historical Background

this overview is from the late 1500s to the mid-1700s. During
this era Japan went from sixty provinces to a unified country
where commerce blossomed.

From 1500 to 1600, Japan was a country incessantly at war as
each of the daimyo (literally "big name" meaning "a feudal
lord") sought to wrestle control of neighboring territories. This
100-year span between 1500 and 1600 is referred to as "Sengoku
Jidai" or, literally, "Age of Country at War." It was a time of dis-
order. By the early 1600s, three extraordinary generals---
Nobunaga Oda, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, and Ieyasu Tokugawa---
had unified Japan over a 40-year period. Their prowess and
achievements are celebrated in Japanese history and folklore.
There is a Japanese saying: "Nobunaga piled the rice,
Hideyoshi kneaded the dough, and Tokugawa ate the cake." In
other words, all three generals contributed to Japan's unifica-
tion but Tokugawa, the last of these great generals, became the
Shogun whose family ruled Japan from 1615 to 1867. This era is
referred to as the Tokugawa Shogunate.

The military conditions that suffused Japan for centuries
became an integral part of candlestick terminology. If you think
about it, trading requires many of the same skills needed to win
a battle. Such skills include strategy, psychology, competition,
strategic withdrawals, and, yes, even luck. So it is not surpris-
ing that throughout this book you will come across candlestick
terms that are based on battlefield analogies. There are "night
and morning attacks," the "advancing three soldiers pattern,"
"counterattack lines," the "gravestone," and so on.

The relative stability engendered by the centralized Japanese
feudal system led by Tokugawa offered new opportunities. The
agrarian economy grew, but more important, there was expan-
sion and ease in domestic trade. By the seventeenth century, a
national market had evolved to replace the system of local and
isolated markets. This concept of a centralized marketplace was
to lead indirectly to the development of technical analysis in
Japan.

Hideyoshi Toyotomi regarded Osaka as Japan's capital and
encouraged its growth as a commercial center. Osaka's easy
access to the sea, at a time where land travel was slow, danger-
ous, and costly, made it a national depot for assembling and
disbursing supplies. It evolved into Japan's greatest city of

commerce and finance. Its wealth and vast storehouses of sup-
plies provided Osaka with the appellation "the Kitchen of
Japan."

Osaka contributed much to price stability by smoothing out
regional differences in supply. In Osaka, life was permeated by
the desire for profit (as opposed to other cities in which money
making was despised). The social system at that time was com-
posed of four classes. In descending order they were the
Soldier, the Farmer, the Artisan, and the Merchant. It took until
the 1700s for merchants to break down the social barrier. Even
today the traditional greeting in Osaka is "Mokarimakka"
which means, "Are you making a profit?"

In Osaka, Yodoya Keian became a war merchant for
Hideyoshi (one of the three great military unifiers). Yodoya had
extraordinary abilities in transporting, distributing, and setting
the price of rice. Yodoya's front yard became so important that
the first rice exchange developed there. He became very
wealthy---as it turned out, too wealthy. The Bakufu (the mili-
tary government led by the Shogun) confiscated his entire for-
tune in 1705 on the charge that he was living in luxury not befit-
ting his social rank. The Bakufu was apprehensive about the
increasing amount of power acquired by certain merchants.
Certain officials and merchants tried to corner the rice market
in 1642. The punishment was severe: Their children were exe-
cuted, the merchants were exiled, and their wealth was confis-
cated.

The rice market that originally developed in Yodoya's yard
was institutionalized when the Dojima Rice Exchange was set
up in the late 1600s in Osaka. The merchants at the Exchange
graded the rice and bargained to set its price. Up until 1710, the
Exchange dealt in actual rice. After 1710, the Rice Exchange
began to issue and accept rice warehouse receipts. These ware-
house receipts were called rice coupons. These rice receipts
became the first futures contracts ever traded.

Rice brokerage became the foundation of Osaka's prosperity.
There were more than 1,300 rice dealers. Since there was no cur-
rency standard (the prior attempts at hard currency failed due
to the debasing of the coins), rice became the de facto medium
of exchange. A daimyo needing money would send his surplus
rice to Osaka where it would be placed in a warehouse in his

name. He would be given a coupon as a receipt for this rice. He
could sell this rice coupon whenever he pleased. Given the
financial problems of many daimyos, they would also often sell
rice coupons against their next rice tax delivery (taxes to the
daimyo were paid in rice---usually 40 to 60 percent of the rice
farmer's crop). Sometimes the rice crop of several years hence
was mortgaged. These rice coupons were actively traded. The
rice coupons sold against future rice deliveries became the
world's first futures contracts. The Dojima Rice Exchange,
where these coupons traded, became the world's first futures
exchange. Rice coupons were also called "empty rice" coupons
(that is, rice that was not in physical possession). To give you an
idea of the popularity of rice futures trading, consider this: In
1749, there were a total of 110,000 bales (rice used to trade in
bales) of empty-rice coupons traded in Osaka. Yet, throughout
all of Japan there were only 30,000 bales of rice."

Into this background steps Homma, called "god of the mar-
kets." Munehisa Homma was born in 1724 into a wealthy fam-
ily. The Homma family was considered so wealthy that there
was a saying at that time, "I will never become a Homma, but
I would settle to be a local lord." When Homma was given con-
trol of his family business in 1750, he began trading at his local
rice exchange in the port city of Sakata. Sakata was a collections
and distribution area for rice. Since Homma came from Sakata,
you will frequently come across the expression "Sakata's
Rules" in Japanese candlestick literature. These refer to
Homma.

When Munehisa Homma's father died, Munehisa was placed
in charge of managing the family's assets. This was in spite of
the fact that he was the youngest son. (It was usually the eldest
son who inherited the power during that era.) This was proba-
bly because of Munehisa's market savvy. With this money,
Homma went to Japan's largest rice exchange, the Dojima Rice
Exchange in Osaka, and began trading rice futures.

Homma's family had a huge rice farming estate. Their power
meant that information about the rice market was usually
available to them. In addition, Homma kept records of yearly
weather conditions. In order to learn about the psychology of
investors, Homma analyzed rice prices going back to the time
when the rice exchange was in Yodoya's yard. Homma also set

up his own communications system. At prearranged times he
placed men on rooftops to send signals by flags. These men
stretched the distance from Osaka to Sakata. After dominating
the Osaka markets, Homma went to trade in the regional
exchange at Edo (now called Tokyo). He used his insights to
amass a huge fortune. It was said he had 100 consecutive win-
ning trades.

His prestige was such that there was the following folk song
from Edo: "When it is sunny in Sakata (Homma's town), it is
cloudy in Dojima (the Dojima Rice Exchange in Osaka) and
rainy at Kuramae (the Kuramae exchange in Edo)." In other
words, when there is a good rice crop in Sakata, rice prices fall

: on the Dojima Rice Exchange and collapse in Edo. This song
reflects Homma's sway over the rice market. In later years
Homma became a financial consultant to the government and
was given the honored title of samurai. He died in 1803.
Homma's books about the markets (Sakata Senho and Soba Sani
No Den) were said to have been written in the 1700s. His trad-
ing principles, as applied to the rice markets, evolved into the
candlestick methodology currently used in Japan.

Notes

1. His first name is sometimes translated as Sokyu and his last name is
sometimes translated as Honma. This gives you an idea of the difficulty
of translating Japanese into English. The same Japanese symbols for

Homma's first name, depending on the translator, can be Sokyu or

Munehisa. His last name, again depending on the translator, can be either

Homma or Honma. I chose the English translation of Homma's name as

used by the Nippon Technical Analysts Association.

Without oars you cannot cross in a boat.
ens charts use the same open, high, low, and close data
as the traditional Western bar chart. With this in mind, a
bar chart is shown in Exhibit 3.1. Exhibit 3.2 is a candle chart of
the same price information as the bar chart.

Prices seem to jump off the page on the candle chart. It pre-
sents a stereoscopic view of the market as it pushes the flat,
two-dimensional bar chart into almost a three-dimensional
aspect. Candle charts are visually stimulating. Exhibit 3.3
shows how the same data looks on a bar chart and then a can-
dle chart.
