# Engulfing Bar Candlestick Pattern Strategies

The engulfing bar pattern is one of the most powerful and profitable price action patterns. Knowing how to use it properly as an entry signal will tremendously improve your trading profitability.

## What is an Engulfing Bar Pattern?

This reversal candlestick pattern consists of two opposite colored bodies in which the second body engulfs or covers entirely the first one.

- A **bullish engulfing pattern** forms at the end of a downtrend. It provides a clear signal that buying pressure has overwhelmed selling pressure. The buyers are now involved.
- A **bearish engulfing pattern** occurs at the end of an uptrend. It is a top trend reversal indicator showing that the bulls are no longer in control and the price trend is likely to reverse.

### Three Criteria (Steve Nison)

According to Steve Nison, the father of modern candlestick charting, this candle must meet three important criteria to be considered a reversal pattern:

1. The market is in a **clearly definable uptrend or downtrend**.
2. The engulfing candle comprises two candlesticks, and the first body is **entirely engulfed** by the second one.
3. The second real body is the **opposite color** of the first real body.

## How to Trade the Engulfing Bar: Three Elements

### 1. The Trend

Trading the engulfing bar pattern with the trend is the easiest way to make money.

- If the market is making series of **higher highs and higher lows**, it is an uptrend.
- If it is making series of **lower highs and lower lows**, it is a downtrend.
- The trend is the most important element in your technical analysis. Never fight it or try to control it.
- "The trend is your friend."

### 2. The Level

When you find a clearly definable uptrend or downtrend, identify the most important **support and resistance levels**.

- If prices test a support level and stop, buyers are there. This area is watched by all participants and represents a great buying opportunity.
- If prices test a resistance level and stop in an uptrend, selling strength is in the market.
- In trending markets, when prices pass through a resistance level, that resistance can become support.
- Other tools to find the best levels: **supply and demand areas**, **moving averages**, and **Fibonacci retracement ratios**.

### 3. The Signal

The signal is an engulfing bar pattern. Your ability to identify an engulfing candlestick at a key level in a clear uptrend or downtrend will greatly enhance the probabilities of making a winning trade.

## Trading with Moving Averages

Trading the engulfing bar pattern with moving averages provides a very profitable trading strategy.

### How Traders Use Moving Averages

- **Trend following tool:** Buy when prices are above the 200 SMA; sell when below.
- **Overbought/oversold:** If prices move far from the MAs in an uptrend, the market is overbought.
- **Trend change prediction:** Using the crossover strategy -- if one MA crosses over another, it signals a trend reversal.

### Warnings

- Moving averages do **not** apply to all markets. Never use them in range-bound or untradeable markets -- you will get many false signals.

### The Strategy

Use the **21 and 8 simple moving averages** in the daily and 4-hour time frames.

1. Define a clear bullish or bearish market.
2. In a bullish market: Buy when price **pulls back to the moving average** and an engulfing bar pattern forms.
3. In a bearish market: Sell when price **retraces to the moving average** and an engulfing bar pattern forms.
4. The moving average acts as **dynamic support** (uptrend) or **dynamic resistance** (downtrend).

## Trading with Fibonacci Retracements

The most important Fibonacci retracement levels are the **50%** and **61%**. Knowing how to use this tool in conjunction with Japanese candlesticks will maximize your profit potential.

### The Strategy

1. Define a clear uptrend or downtrend.
2. Define major corrective levels using the Fibonacci retracement tool.
3. If you see an engulfing bar pattern matching up with the **50% or 61% levels**, it is a powerful price action trading signal.

### Key Insight

- According to chart technicians, most major moves retrace around **50% or 61%** Fibonacci retracement.
- This knowledge provides the ability to predict with high accuracy the next major move in a trending market.
- Trading from 50% and 61% Fibonacci levels means you are trading from better price levels, putting as many probabilities in your favor as possible.
- The resistance level that becomes support is another confirmation to take this high-probability setup.

## Trading with Trendlines

Trend lines give traders an idea about the psychology of the market -- the psychology between buyers and sellers. They allow professional traders to determine whether the market is pessimistic or optimistic.

### Uses of Trendlines

- As support and resistance by drawing them horizontally.
- To identify price and time by drawing them vertically.
- In trending markets, connect **swing highs** or **swing lows** to find high-probability entry setups in line with the general trend.

### The Strategy

- By connecting the extreme highs, you create a trend line acting as a **resistance level**. The formation of an engulfing bar pattern at this level shows a good selling opportunity.
- By connecting the extreme lows, the trend line acts as a **support level**. The formation of an engulfing bar at this level is a good buying opportunity.
- If you only used horizontal support and resistance levels, you would miss these profitable trades.
- Learning about how to draw trend lines is never a bad idea. It is the simplest analytic tool and works in all markets (forex, commodities, futures, or options).

## Trading in Sideways Markets

One of the most difficult markets to predict is the sideways/ranging market. Markets spend more than **70% of their time** in ranging motion, so learning how to approach range-bound markets is a must.

### Identifying a Range-Bound Market

When the market stops making higher highs and higher lows (uptrend) or lower highs and lower lows (downtrend), and starts acting between a specific high price and low price, it is ranging.

### Differentiating Sideways vs. Choppy Markets

Be selective about trading range-bound markets. You must differentiate between **sideways** and **choppy** markets:

- **Sideways:** Clear horizontal support and resistance boundaries. Tradeable.
- **Choppy:** The market trades in a crazy way; you cannot identify major support or resistance. Stay away from these markets.

### Strategy 1: Trade from Support and Resistance

Buy at the support level and sell at the resistance level when an engulfing bar forms at these boundaries.

### Strategy 2: Trade the Breakout (or Pullback)

- Trade the breakout of the range.
- Or wait for the pullback after the breakout, then enter.

### Strategy 3: Trade the False Breakout

False breakouts are one of the most powerful price action strategies. They occur in all types of markets.

- If you know how to use false breakouts in combination with the engulfing bar pattern at a major support or resistance level, you will buy the bottoms and sell the tops intelligently.
- A false breakout happens when amateurs try to predict a breakout early, but the market fakes them out (forming a bull or bear trap).

## Trading with Supply and Demand Zones

Supply and demand areas are **more powerful than support and resistance**. They represent the place where banks and institutions are buying and selling.

### Three Factors Defining Quality Supply and Demand Areas

1. **Strength of the move:** Pay attention to how the price leaves the zone. If the market leaves quickly, banks and institutions are there.
2. **Good profit zone:** Make sure the level provides a good risk/reward.
3. **Bigger time frames:** The daily and 4-hour supply and demand areas are the most powerful zones.

### The Strategy

- Identify quality supply or demand zones.
- Wait for an engulfing bar to form at these zones.
- The formation of an engulfing bar is a clear signal that sellers (at supply) or buyers (at demand) are still willing to trade from the same price level.
- The secret behind supply and demand areas is that **big players put their pending orders there**. When the market approaches these zones, a strong move occurs from these levels.

## Money Management Rules for Engulfing Bar Trades

Not all engulfing bar patterns are worth trading. Price action signals with low risk/reward ratios should be ignored.

### Risk-to-Reward Ratio

- Once the criteria for a high-probability setup are in place, make sure your trade has a potential of **at least 2:1 risk-to-reward ratio**.
- The amount you will win must be **at least twice** the amount you will risk.

### Case Study

Imagine you take 10 trades with 3:1 risk/reward on each trade (risk $200, win $600):

- You lost 7 trades: -$1,400
- You won 3 trades: +$1,800
- **Net profit: $400**

Even with only a 30% win rate, you are still making money. This is the power of money management.

### Entry and Exit Rules

1. When you identify an engulfing bar pattern and all conditions are in place, **take an order immediately** after the signal forms.
2. **Stop loss:** Below the candlestick pattern (for buys) or above (for sells).
3. **Profit target:** The next support or resistance level.
4. Once you set your protective stop and target, **do not look back**. Let the market tell you if you are wrong or right.

### Capital Protection Rules

- Successful traders do not risk more than **2% of equity** on each single trade.
- If you are a beginner, do not risk more than **1%**.
- Do not risk money you cannot afford on a single trade, even if the signal indicates a high-probability setup.
- Always think in terms of probabilities. You can experience series of losing trades; if you risk too much, you will not survive.
