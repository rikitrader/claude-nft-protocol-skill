# Regulatory Considerations

## Disclaimer

This document provides general educational information only. It is NOT legal advice. Consult qualified legal counsel in your jurisdiction before launching any token.

## Key Regulatory Risks

### Securities Classification

**The Howey Test (US):**

A token may be classified as a security if:
1. Investment of money
2. In a common enterprise
3. With expectation of profits
4. Derived from efforts of others

**Risk Mitigation:**
- No promises of returns
- Decentralized governance
- Utility over speculation
- Community-driven development

### Stablecoin Regulations

If your token claims ANY price stability:
- May trigger banking regulations
- May require reserves
- May need licensing

**Our Approach (Stablecoin-Adjacent):**
- ❌ No fixed $ peg
- ❌ No guaranteed redemption
- ❌ No yield promises
- ✅ Transparent buyback mechanics
- ✅ Treasury-backed floor (not peg)
- ✅ Clear disclosures

### Money Transmission

Operating a bridge or exchange may require:
- Money transmitter license (US)
- Similar licenses in other jurisdictions
- AML/KYC procedures

**Mitigation:**
- Use established DEXs (Raydium, Jupiter)
- Non-custodial design
- No direct fiat on/off ramps

## Jurisdiction Considerations

### High-Risk Jurisdictions

| Jurisdiction | Risk Level | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| United States | High | SEC enforcement active |
| China | Prohibited | Crypto banned |
| India | High | 30% crypto tax + 1% TDS on transfers |
| EU | High | MiCA fully in force since Dec 2024; licensing required |
| Singapore | Medium | MAS licensing framework |
| UAE | Medium-Low | VARA licensing required in Dubai; relatively crypto-friendly |

### Recommended Practices

1. **Geo-blocking**
   - Block US IPs from token sale
   - Clear terms of service
   - Country restrictions documented

2. **Entity Structure**
   - Consider offshore foundation
   - Separate development entity
   - Legal opinion on structure

3. **Documentation**
   - No profit promises
   - Risk disclosures
   - Utility descriptions

### Stablecoin-Adjacent Disclosure

If using treasury buyback mechanics:

```markdown
## STABILITY MECHANISM DISCLOSURE

This token implements treasury buyback mechanics that MAY
provide price support. This is NOT:
- A guaranteed price floor

- An investment product

The treasury may:

- Be subject to governance changes
