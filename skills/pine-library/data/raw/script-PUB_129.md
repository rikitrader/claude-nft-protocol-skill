// MACD – Moving Average Convergence Divergence. The MACD is calculated 
// by subtracting a 26-day moving average of a security's price from a 
// 12-day moving average of its price. The result is an indicator that 
// oscillates above and below zero. When the MACD is above zero, it means 
// the 12-day moving average is higher than the 26-day moving average. 
// This is bullish as it shows that current expectations (i.e., the 12-day 
// moving average) are more bullish than previous expectations (i.e., the 
// 26-day average). This implies a bullish, or upward, shift in the supply/demand 
// lines. When the MACD falls below zero, it means that the 12-day moving average 
// is less than the 26-day moving average, implying a bearish shift in the 
// supply/demand lines.
// A 9-day moving average of the MACD (not of the security's price) is usually 
// plotted on top of the MACD indicator. This line is referred to as the "signal" 
// line. The signal line anticipates the convergence of the two moving averages 
// (i.e., the movement of the MACD toward the zero line).
// Let's consider the rational behind this technique. The MACD is the difference 
// between two moving averages of price. When the shorter-term moving average rises 
// above the longer-term moving average (i.e., the MACD rises above zero), it means 
// that investor expectations are becoming more bullish (i.e., there has been an 
// upward shift in the supply/demand lines). By plotting a 9-day moving average of 
// the MACD, we can see the changing of expectations (i.e., the shifting of the 
// supply/demand lines) as they occur.
