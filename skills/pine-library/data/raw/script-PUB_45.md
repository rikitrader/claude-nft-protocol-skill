# Description
Custom Indicator for Donchian Channels!!! System Rules Included!

# Source Code
```pine
//Modified Donchonian Channel with separate adjustments for upper and lower levels
//Purpose is if you expect big move up, Use lower input example 3 or 4, and longer lower input, 40 - 100 and use lower input line as a stop out
//Opposite if you expect big move down
//Mid Line Rule in Long Example.  If lower line is below entry take partial profits at Mid Line and move stop to Break even.
//If Lower line moves above entry price before price retraces to midline use Lower line as Stop...Opposite if Shorting
