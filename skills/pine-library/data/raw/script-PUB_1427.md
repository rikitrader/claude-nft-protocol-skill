# Description
Candlestick Patterns With EMA and Stochastic

# Source Code
```pine
//Created by Robert Waddell with special thanks to repo32 for his candlestick ID code, DavidR for EMA code and Chris Moody for barcolor code.
//Also a shameless plug for repo32's "Price above/below EMA" and Chris Moody's "Stochastic MTF"
//6/5/15
//Candlestick analysis with buy signals
//Candlestick patterns are identified above or below the price action.
