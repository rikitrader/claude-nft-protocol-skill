// The RSI is a very popular indicator that follows price activity. 
// It calculates an average of the positive net changes, and an average 
// of the negative net changes in the most recent bars, and it determines 
// the ratio between these averages. The result is expressed as a number 
// between 0 and 100. Commonly it is said that if the RSI has a low value, 
// for example 30 or under, the symbol is oversold. And if the RSI has a 
// high value, 70 for example, the symbol is overbought.
